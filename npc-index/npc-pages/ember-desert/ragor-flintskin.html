    <h1 class="npc-title">Ragor Flintskin – The Blade That Broke the Dust</h1>
    <br>
    <section class="npc-story">
      <p>Ragor Flintskin was born in the dry crook of nowhere, in the cracked lands of the northeast Ember Desert. His childhood was stitched together with dust, grit, and the stubborn heartbeat of survival. His family lived in a battered hut right on the beach, eking out a life from what little the desert allowed. They hunted sandhares and desert fowl, fished for food and for fun, farmed cactus fruit and bloodroot, and built their lives from patience and pain.</p>

      <p>But they loved him fiercely. What they lacked in gold, they gave in stories, discipline, and pride. His mother taught him to skin a razorbeak before he could read. His father showed him how to track by starlight. And though he was half-orc, a bloodline despised by many, they never once let him feel less.</p>

      <p>Ragor vowed he’d repay them.</p>

      <p>At seventeen, he left. Joined the Ember Guard. Pledged himself to the great city of Ember Spire. The military didn't welcome him with warmth, but it taught him how to fight. And Ragor didn’t need warmth. Just structure. Just something to sharpen himself against. He rose quickly. Dominated the sparring yards. Outmatched his peers in sand combat, siege drills, close quarters, long range, anything and everything they threw his way.</p>

      <p>He saw no war. No grand campaigns. Just drills, caravan patrols, and border tensions. But he drank in the training. Learned how to lead. How to read terrain. How to make a plan and change it on the fly mid battle.</p>

      <p>When he finally left the service, he took everything he owned—gold, gear, grit—and went home. Gave most of it to his parents. Watched them cry for the first time.</p>

      <p>Then he gathered his old veteran comrades.</p>

      <p>They were six at first. Scarred, tired, burned by the world in different ways. But Ragor had a vision. He sold them on it with scars and smiles.</p>

      <p>The job that changed everything came from a mad prince in the borderlands of the Whispering Wastes. Said his palace had been taken over by a "mirage beast" that created endless duplicates of itself from the sun's reflection, and his entire guard was dead or screaming. The pay was insane. The danger worse. So, naturally, they said yes.</p>

      <p>It took them seven days to find the creature and four more to kill it. It bled sunlight. One of Ragor’s crew got turned into glass. Another vanished into a heat shimmer and never came back. But they won.</p>

      <p>After that, the contracts came rolling in.</p>

      <p>They called themselves the Red Dune Legion. Because blood sinks fast in hot sand, and theirs had long since mixed with the desert. They bought a war forged sand skiff the size of a small village, rigged with ballistae, rune-plated armor, and drop ramps for shock assaults. They formed a proper guild. Took outposts in the Ember Desert, the Redspire Coast, even one on a small set of islands on the edge of the Empire of Tides, where they work closely with The Leviathan’s Wake.</p>

      <p>They cost a fortune. But they deliver every time.</p>

      <p>And if you were just a poor traveler, bleeding in the sand? They’d help you too. No charge. Patch your wounds, feed your camel, give you a ride to the nearest city and a bed to rest in. All they ask is simple:</p>

      <p><em>"Next time you need something impossible done, come to us."</em></p>

      <p>Ragor still captains the skiff. Still leads from the front. His armor is scorched, his axe engraved with names of fallen comrades, and his voice like a landslide.</p>

      <p>He lives for his men. For the guild. For the impossible odds.</p>

      <p>But most of all, he lives for his family.</p>

      <p>Seventy-five percent of every gold piece he earns goes straight back to them. The Flintskins now reside in a marble-clad dreamhouse in Ember Spire’s Emerald Terrace, far from the dust, far from the thirst. And Ragor? He doesn’t need that life.</p>

      <p>The desert still calls him. And he answers. Loudly, violently, and always on time.</p>

    <h2 class="npc-title">Of Gunfire, Flares, and Brotherhood Forged in Sand</h2>
    <br>
    <section class="npc-story">
      <p>The bounty hunters never saw the skiff coming.</p>

      <p>It tore across the dunes like a beast unchained—blades on its prow, red banners snapping like war drums in the wind. At its helm stood Ragor Flintskin, half-orc, half-sandstorm, the sun glinting off his bare chest and the twin axes strapped to his back. He spotted the fight before the dust cleared—one man and one construct, backs to a broken dune, surrounded by bodies that kept getting back up.</p>

      <p>He knew the type. Bounty hunters. Bottom-feeders with a badge and a butcher’s grin.</p>

      <p>Ragor had met plenty in his time. He’d killed more than his share.</p>

      <p>The skiff ground to a halt in a burst of grit. Ragor leapt down with the fury of a collapsing cliff. He didn’t ask names. He didn’t check sides. He just started swinging. And within minutes, the would-be collectors were corpses, and the air smelled of blood and scorched metal.</p>

      <p>The man—lean, dust-covered, with a glare that had seen too many sunrises—gave a wary nod.</p>

      <p>"Vash," he said.</p>

      <p>The construct, quiet and still, simply inclined its head.</p>

      <p>"Name’s Ragor," the half-orc grunted, offering a hand thick with callus and old scars. "You look like shit. Get on the skiff."</p>

      <p>They rode together for a time. Vash didn’t say much. Neither did Dent. But they earned their keep. When contracts came calling, they fought. They hauled, repaired, patrolled—whatever the Legion needed. Ragor liked them. They didn’t ask dumb questions. Didn’t get in the way. And when it counted, they hit hard.</p>

      <p>When the time came for them to part ways, Ragor pulled Vash aside.</p>

      <p>He handed him two things: a compact hand mortar—clean, oiled, deadly—and a single crimson flare.</p>

      <p>"You fire that, I come," Ragor said. "Doesn’t matter where you are. You shoot that thing into the sky, and I’ll bring the skiff. You want out of the sand, out of the running, out of the bounty bullshit—you’ve got a place with the Red Dune Legion."</p>

      <p>He didn’t ask for a decision. Just clapped Vash on the shoulder and walked away.</p>

      <p>Sometimes, the only family you get is the one that rides beside you for a few miles... and leaves a weapon in your hand when they go.</p>

    <h2 class="npc-title">Of Shadows, Secrets, and the Weight of a Name</h2>
    <br>
    <section class="npc-story">
      <p>Ragor Flintskin wasn’t fond of politics. But he respected people who got shit done.</p>

      <p>He met Shade in Ember Spire, where business was hot, and the work even hotter. She didn’t come to him with pleasantries or pomp—just a list of names and the coin to make them disappear. Ragor didn’t need to ask how she knew who to target. He could see it in her eyes—too sharp for someone just looking to stay safe.</p>

      <p>They worked together more and more. When something ugly needed cleaning up, and her own network was stretched thin, she’d call the Red Dune Legion. Not because they were convenient. Because they were the best.</p>

      <p>And Ragor? He noticed things. Patterns. Silences.</p>

      <p>He connected the dots.</p>

      <p>He knew who she really was.</p>

      <p>He never said it aloud. Never spoke the name.</p>

      <p>He just kept calling her Shade.</p>

      <p>Out of respect. Out of understanding. Out of loyalty to someone who, like him, carried a heavier weight than they let on.</p>

      <p>And when the time came, she rewarded him in kind.</p>

      <p>The Empire of Tides had long claimed the chain of islands skimming their western border—useless land to them, but valuable to Ragor. He needed an outpost, a place to dock, refuel, and train. Shade said the right words, made the right offers, pulled the right strings. The Empire stepped back.</p>

      <p>And the Red Dune Legion stepped in.</p>

      <p>Now those islands fly red banners and echo with steel on steel. Recruits come from all over the realm to train in the heat, under Ragor’s brutal eye and the Legion’s banner.</p>

      <p>Because if you want something done right in the desert—you call the Legion.</p>

      <p>And if you’re smart, you never cross the Velvet Mask.</p>

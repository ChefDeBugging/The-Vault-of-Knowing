    <br>
    <section class="npc-story">
      <p>Dren Volgar didn’t come from nothing.</p>

      <p>He came from worse.</p>

      <p>The sort of home that suffocated joy and weaponized hunger. His parents were cruel, bitter things who viewed affection as weakness and saw Dren as little more than another mouth to curse. There were no lullabies in his childhood, only slammed doors and the sound of blame. He learned early that the world wouldn’t give him anything—and that if he wanted more, he’d have to take it.</p>

      <p>So he did.</p>

      <p>He ran off young. Scraped by on petty theft, lies, and the occasional lucky coin tossed by a guilt-ridden merchant. But real change didn’t come until he fell through the floor of an old ruin—quite literally. A collapsed tunnel outside a forgotten shrine swallowed him whole, and for days, he was trapped in the belly of stone and silence. Until, desperate and bloodied, he stumbled upon a hidden undercroft.</p>

      <p>And there it was.</p>

      <p>Gold. Jewels. An altar lined with bones and obsidian icons, offerings untouched by time.</p>

      <p>It was the most beautiful thing he’d ever seen.</p>

      <p>That was the day Dren Volgar found purpose.</p>

      <p>He used the treasure to buy land in the middle of nowhere, a few miles south of Stonewind, and built himself a home. Not a house. A fortress. Every wall, every hallway, every entry point was laced with traps, deadfalls, and pressure plates. The safest place in the desert was the center of Dren’s little empire—because nobody else could survive it.</p>

      <p>And from there, he built his legacy.</p>

      <p>Dren Volgar became the name whispered by tomb raiders and treasure hunters, both as a curse and as an idol. He knew every ruin in the Ember Desert, every tomb worth cracking open, every legend that might lead to something valuable buried beneath the sand. His fingers knew the weight of pressure plates. His ears could hear the hiss of hidden darts before they sprang. He was greedy, twitchy, and always three steps ahead.</p>

      <p>But his reputation came with consequence.</p>

      <p>The Ironwood refused him entry, calling him a desecrator of sacred grounds. Eldara barred him entirely, the Scholarium labeling him a parasite feeding on the bones of the past. Even in the Empire of Tides, where greed was no vice, his methods earned wary glances and locked doors.</p>

      <p>And Dren didn’t care.</p>

      <p>Because gold still gleamed in the dark.</p>

      <p>Because somewhere, beneath dust and silence, a sealed chamber still waited to be found.</p>

      <p>Because every curse had a crack, and every lock a weakness.</p>

      <p>He’d find them.</p>

      <p>And he’d take what he pleased.</p>

    <br>
    <section class="npc-story">
      <p>The first time Shade saw Dren Volgar, she was just a child.</p>

      <p>He stood outside a windswept ruin in the Ember Desert, hands jittery, eyes darting like a cornered animal. She hadn’t meant to be there, hadn’t even been told. But Fog was there too, speaking with the man in hushed, heated tones. Their voices didn’t carry, but the tension was thick as the desert heat. Dren gestured wildly, waving something wrapped in cloth. Fog didn’t flinch. Just listened. Just stared.</p>

      <p>Shade never forgot that.</p>

      <p>She didn’t see Dren again until years later. By then she was older, trained, sharper. She and Fog had been trailing a relic smuggler through the dust-choked edges of the Empire of Tides, and when they finally caught up to him, it was Volgar. Older, twitchier, even more paranoid. His fortress of traps had slowed their approach, but not stopped it. Fog confronted him alone, demanding something Shade never fully learned. There was shouting. Steel. Blood. But it ended with chains. Volgar cuffed, bruised, but smirking.</p>

      <p>He struck a deal.</p>

      <p>Shade never knew the terms. Only that afterward, Dren Volgar wasn't seen in chains again.</p>

      <p>Years passed.</p>

      <p>Now, as the Velvet Mask, Shade sees him rarely. He knows better than to show up uninvited. And she knows better than to trust him.</p>

      <p>But trust and utility aren’t always the same thing.</p>

      <p>Dren has a knack for finding what shouldn't be found. Tombs buried for centuries. Relics sealed away by divine wards. Maps that whisper and traps that bleed. When knowledge is needed—especially knowledge wrapped in curses and sand—there are few better. Or worse.</p>

      <p>Their interactions are brief. Tense. She gives him nothing he doesn’t need. He gives her information because it keeps him relevant, keeps her from turning her blades on him.</p>

      <p>No friendship. No fondness.</p>

      <p>Only the reluctant thread of shared necessity.</p>

      <p>She loathes what he is.</p>

      <p>But she knows exactly how valuable the worst kind of man can be.</p>

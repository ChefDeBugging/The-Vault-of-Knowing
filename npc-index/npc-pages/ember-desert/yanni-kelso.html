    <h1 class="npc-title">Yanni "The Ember Rat" Kelso – The King of Ozar’teth</h1>
    <br>
    <section class="npc-story">
      <p>Yanni Kelso was born in a gutter with a name he gave himself. Not the gutter part—that was real. But Ozar’teth? That was his invention. A grand name, half-joke and half-dream, whispered between the cracked bricks of Ember Spire’s undercity. To anyone else, it was just another slum—another maze of pipes, soot, and rust-colored stone. But to Yanni and his friends, it was a kingdom. And every kingdom needs a name.</p>

      <p>His parents were ghosts. Their hands always full of things they never owned. They vanished one day—too deep in the game to crawl back out. Yanni didn't mourn. He tightened his boots, rounded up his crew, and took control of what little turf they had. They were just kids then, scraping copper from alley grates, lifting charms from distracted vendors, and running from guards more out of habit than fear.</p>

      <p>But even then, Yanni was different.</p>

      <p>Quick with a grin, quicker with a plan. He memorized guard rotations. Marked trapdoors and waterlines. Knew which fences paid best, and which ones were likely to disappear you if you brought the wrong trinket. The Ember Rats became more than a street crew—they were a network. An ecosystem.</p>

      <p>And then the letter arrived.</p>

      <p>Delivered by hand, tucked into a coin purse that shouldn’t have held paper at all. No signature. No seal. Just a sentence written in elegant, efficient ink:<br>
      <em>"You're playing in shallow puddles. There’s an ocean waiting."</em></p>

      <p>Yanni read it once and didn’t stop grinning for an hour. It wasn’t a threat. It was a door.</p>

      <p>What came next wasn’t war. It was growth. Quietly, precisely, the Ember Rats turned into something sharper. Cleaner. More dangerous. A trade guild—officially chartered, formally taxed, fully legitimate. The Ember Veil Trading Company began offering rare spell reagents, salvaged relics, and exotic oddities. All above board. All with paperwork.</p>

      <p>But behind the curtain, under the veil, a second name whispered through back rooms and torchlit tunnels: <strong>The Velvet Exchange</strong>.</p>

      <p>This was where the real power lived. In the Velvet Exchange, there were no ledgers. No receipts. Just contracts written in cipher and trust. Black-market scrolls, bound spirits, veilborn artifacts, void-blood ink—if it could be found, it could be bought. If it couldn’t, Yanni knew who could make it.</p>

      <p>He wears no crown. Just a patchwork cloak of stolen silks, a blade no taller than a boot, and a grin that makes nobles nervous. He’s sharp, fast-talking, and magnetic in the way only someone who knows ten ways to kill you—and five ways to make you rich—can be.</p>

      <p>Everyone in Ember Spire knows Yanni Kelso. But not everyone knows the man behind the curtain. Not everyone knows what Ozar’teth really means. Or who the Velvet Exchange answers to.</p>

      <p>But Yanni? He remembers the gutter. He remembers the name he gave it. And now the whole city remembers his.</p>

    <h2 class="npc-title">Of Rats, Masks, and Market Kings</h2>
    <br>
    <section class="npc-story">
      <p>In the whispering maze of Ember Spire’s Underspire, it started—as most things do—with a rumor.</p>

      <p>A pack of street kids. Petty thieves. Nothing unusual. But these ones weren’t stupid. They weren’t sloppy. They were organized.</p>

      <p>Shade heard the whispers at first in passing—little voices, always laughing, always running. Traded charms here, vanished coin purses there. A missing crate of spellglass. A shipment of forged scrolls that never arrived.</p>

      <p>At first, she dismissed it. A cute story. Kids playing dress-up in the alley shadows. But the whispers didn’t stop. And that was the first sign.</p>

      <p>She started watching. Digging. Listening closely to who was really pulling the strings. The trail led her to a name scrawled across alley walls and vendor crates, always in bright chalk: <strong>The Ember Rat</strong>.</p>

      <p>Not a myth. Not a front. A halfling boy, maybe ten or eleven when she first laid eyes on him. Sharp-eyed, loud-mouthed, standing atop a broken crate like it was a throne. And the others listened. Moved when he moved. Laughed when he laughed. They were kids, sure—but they ran tighter than most guilds she’d seen.</p>

      <p>Shade watched. And smiled.</p>

      <p>She didn’t speak to him. Not yet. Instead, she left a note tucked into a stolen pouch the crew lifted from a merchant the week before. No name. No contact. Just a single line:<br>
      <em>"You're playing in shallow puddles. There’s an ocean waiting."</em></p>

      <p>Yanni read it, and something shifted.</p>

      <p>Weeks passed. Then months. Shade kept watching as his operations grew. Became cleaner. More daring. And when she saw that he was ready—when the boy had turned the puddle into a lake—she stepped from the shadows.</p>

      <p>She didn’t offer him gold. She offered him vision. An official license to trade under the banner of the Ember Veil Trading Company, a legal shell for the network she was building. And behind the veil? The truth. A lesson in running shadows, not just dancing through them. She taught him about leverage. Silence. Value. How to move goods that shouldn’t exist, in ways that couldn’t be tracked.</p>

      <p>And when she introduced him to Selene—a highborn enchantress from the Celestial Highlands with more talent than tact—it all clicked. Selene needed reach. Yanni needed product. Shade needed both.</p>

      <p>Yanni named the secret arm of his operation <strong>The Velvet Exchange</strong>, linking it by name to hers. Not as subservience. As solidarity. A quiet, permanent message to every buyer, broker, and backdoor noble:<br>
      <em>"You’re in our house now."</em></p>

      <p>Since then, the Velvet Exchange has become the most elusive and expansive black market in existence. Hidden behind the legitimacy of trade routes and storefronts. Whispers claim its vaults hold relics from the Sundering, inks made from godsblood, and scrolls that rewrite memory itself.</p>

      <p>But no matter how big it gets, no matter how many rings he wears or brokers he breaks—Yanni never forgets where it started. With chalk on brick. With a letter in a stolen pouch. With someone who saw not a rat—but a king in the making.</p>

    <h1 class="npc-title">Ora'ma Tal – Whispers Beneath the Blood Moon</h1>
    <br>
    <section class="npc-story">
      <p>In the blistering wilds of the Ember Desert, where the sun hammers the dunes and the wind carves ancient hymns into stone, there walks a figure spoken of in murmurs and myths. Ora’ma Tal. The Flame-Touched Oracle. A dragonborn whose presence feels older than the desert itself, and whose cracked lips murmur futures like embers drifting from a dying flame.</p>

      <p>Nobody knows where she came from. No tales speak of her hatching. No tribe remembers her arrival. She has simply always been—moving like smoke among the wandering herds of the Goliath clans. When a child sees her first, they are taught not to fear. When an elder greets her, they do so with a bowed head and open palm, as one might greet fire itself.</p>

      <p>To the Goliaths, she is the Oracle. The fire between the stones. The voice of the storm before it breaks. Her prophecies do not come as declarations but as fragments—half-whispers burned into memory, scattered like coals in a brazier. But when one truly listens, when the time is right, the flame speaks clearly.</p>

      <p>She has witnessed births, deaths, victories, and disasters. She has ushered new chieftains into power and watched ancient herds crumble into dust. Through it all, her presence remains the same—smoke-threaded robes, eyes alight with flickering flame, voice dry as scorched earth, yet ringing with truth.</p>

      <p>Once every five years, the scattered Goliath herds converge upon the Plains of Roaring Silence, a rare union drawn by the celestial event known as the Eclipse of Two Moons—a moment when both the Blood Moon and the Water Moon align and pass before the sun, plunging the desert into crimson dusk. It is during this eerie twilight that Ora’ma Tal performs the Ritual of Ember Oaths.</p>

      <p>The ritual begins at dawn, with each newly come-of-age Goliath crafting a weapon or totem from the bones of the desert—shaped stone, seared metal, scavenged bone, whatever they can forge under the sun’s gaze. They gather in a great circle around a fire built not of wood, but of enchanted glass and phoenix feathers, blazing white-hot.</p>

      <p>Ora’ma Tal enters the center, barefoot upon the burning sand, untouched by the heat. She drinks from a bowl of molten copper, speaks in tongues known only to time, and casts the liquid into the flames. The fire rises and dances, changing colors with each name she utters.</p>

      <p>Then she touches each Goliath, placing a searing hand on their brow and whispering words none remember but all feel. When she finishes, they fall to their knees, overcome, and rise with storm in their hearts and stone in their veins.</p>

      <p>This is their binding—the moment they become more than wanderers. They are now part of the Ember Oath, sworn to the balance of fury and endurance. Some call it magic. Others call it madness. But all call it sacred.</p>

      <p>And when the sun returns, when the moons pass on and the stars reclaim the sky, Ora’ma Tal vanishes once more. No one ever sees her leave. She simply is gone—carried, perhaps, by flame, or by fate.</p>

      <p>But the herds remember. The stones remember. The fire never forgets.</p>

      <p>And somewhere out there, beneath a sky of burning red, Ora’ma Tal mutters her next prophecy—eyes flickering, always watching, always waiting.</p>

    <h2 class="npc-title">Of Embers and Forgotten Echoes</h2>
    <br>
    <section class="npc-story">
      <p>Meebs was born under a blazing orange sky—one of those desert sunsets that sets fire to the whole world. The wind was still. The sand, silent. And the moment she cried her first breath into the dusk, Ora’ma Tal was already there.</p>

      <p>No one saw her arrive.</p>

      <p>She stood just outside the birthing tent, cracked lips twitching with a prophecy already spilling out. No request. No ceremony. Just words—half in Common, half in something older—spilling like smoke:</p>

      <p><em>“Born not to the stone, nor to storm—she is flame remembered. Riftborn. Veil-marked. Bound to the thread between what is broken and what may yet be.”</em></p>

      <p>Most of the herd didn’t understand. Some were unnerved. Others simply nodded, letting the words pass them like so many others that had come before. That was the way of Ora’ma Tal.</p>

      <p>She was the flame-touched grandmother of the Ember herds. She came and went like a shifting wind—offering sweets to the children, small trinkets wrapped in linen, wooden carvings that whispered when held. To the young, she was kindness and mystery. To the old, she was a riddle in a cloak of fire.</p>

      <p>Meebs met her many times as she grew—never for long, always in passing. Sometimes at dusk, sometimes after dreams. Ora’ma would sit in the sand and let the younger ones ask questions she wouldn’t answer, or would answer with a poem, or a joke, or a strange little toy that spun on its own.</p>

      <p>But always—always—she spoke of the Riftborn.</p>

      <p>She never explained what it meant.</p>

      <p>Meebs asked, of course. Many times. What is the Veil? What is broken? What am I meant to do?</p>

      <p>Ora’ma would only smile, and tap her own temple with a singed claw. “You’ll know when you know, little ember.”</p>

      <p>The Ritual of Ember Oaths was no different.</p>

      <p>Meebs stood among others her age, each one ready to take their path—to be marked by fire, bound to the desert, stone, and sky. The ceremony was unforgettable. The air shimmered with heat, and the very sand seemed to rise like mist around them. Flame danced without burning. Symbols appeared and vanished on their skin. They felt changed.</p>

      <p>And yet—strangely—most of them couldn’t recall the details days later. Only feelings. Only the memory of awe. And somewhere in that haze stood Ora’ma, whispering things they couldn’t hold on to.</p>

      <p>The last time Meebs saw her, she was preparing to leave.</p>

      <p>The road called. The world stretched beyond the dunes, and Meebs—stubborn, wild-hearted Meebs—was ready to chase it.</p>

      <p>But guilt lingered. Worry. The weight of leaving her people.</p>

      <p>Ora’ma found her alone, tracing spirals in the dirt.</p>

      <p>She sat beside her in silence for a long time. Then, without looking up, she said:</p>

      <p><em>“It’s time. They’ll be safe. I’ll watch them. And when you’re needed… you’ll hear the fire call your name.”</em></p>

      <p>Meebs said nothing, but she cried anyway. Just a little.</p>

      <p>Ora’ma placed something in her hand—a stone, carved into the shape of an eye, warm to the touch.</p>

      <p><em>“For when the sky forgets. For when you remember.”</em></p>

      <p>And then she was gone.</p>

      <p>No farewell. No flare of light. Just absence.</p>

      <p>And Meebs left the next morning.</p>

      <p>She never saw Ora’ma Tal again.</p>

      <p>But she still keeps the stone. It still feels warm.</p>

    <br>
    <section class="npc-story">
      <p>They whispered when she passed. They always had.</p>

      <p>Some said she was cursed. Others said she was a demon in a girl’s skin, a punishment born of a pact long forgotten. No one knew the truth, only the shape of her horns, the color of her eyes, and the chill her silence carried.</p>

      <p>Sazhra was born in Embertide, where the sea lapped at the southern edge of the Ember Desert. A bustling coastal city full of heat, color, and trade—but none of it welcomed her. Her family never raised a hand against her, but neither did they raise a voice in her defense. They clothed her, fed her, educated her. But never embraced her.</p>

      <p>They whispered when she passed. They always had.</p>

      <p>Not when the other children spat slurs in the alleys. Not when merchants muttered behind their stalls. Not when teachers paused at her name on the roster.</p>

      <p><em>Tiefling.</em></p>

      <p>They didn't say it. They sighed it.</p>

      <p>And when the sighs became silence, Sazhra left.</p>

      <p>She took no provisions. No map. Just a cloak, a waterskin, and her fury. She turned her back on Embertide and stepped into the burning, breathless jaws of the desert.</p>

      <p>The sands did not welcome her.</p>

      <p>But they did not judge her, either.</p>

      <p>At first, she stumbled. Fought. Cried. Sandstorms cut her skin raw. Night terrors prowled her camps. She nearly died, more than once. But she learned. She watched. She listened to the dunes, the winds, the weight of silence.</p>

      <p>And slowly, they whispered back.</p>

      <p>Time lost meaning. She wandered. Fought bandits. Outran monsters with teeth like tombstones. Outlasted mages with cruel smiles and dry hands. Some feared her and fled. Others attacked and vanished beneath the sand. None stayed.</p>

      <p>Until the Sandwalkers.</p>

      <p>A band of wanderers—humans, dwarves, one half-orc, and an elf with no tongue. They moved across the desert without stirring it, their steps soft as prayer. Sazhra watched them from afar for three days before revealing herself. They offered no questions. Only water, and a nod.</p>

      <p>She traveled with them. Learned their art. How to move without weight. How to whisper to the wind and feel its answer. How to step where the sand sleeps, and not wake what hunts beneath.</p>

      <p>They never asked her about her horns.</p>

      <p>She never offered.</p>

      <p>Years passed. Her gait grew lighter. Her mind quieter. Her silence no longer a wound, but a blade—sharp, useful, hers.</p>

      <p>Then came the board.</p>

      <p>A broken dune-runner left behind after a skirmish with raiders. Sazhra fixed it. Then modified it. Then transformed it into something else entirely. Sleeker. Meaner. Swift enough to ride the wind and carve the storm. It became her signature—and her release.</p>

      <p>On the dunes, she danced.</p>

      <p>Locals began to whisper again. But not in fear.</p>

      <p>In awe.</p>

      <p>They called her the Sandwalker. The Dunewhisper. The Stormrider. Some said she was born of the desert itself. She said nothing. Just guided travelers, trained riders, and vanished into the horizon when the sun burned too bright.</p>

      <p>Now, pilgrims seek her for safe passage. Thrill-seekers beg for dune-drifting lessons. And every so often, someone from Embertide tries to find her.</p>

      <p>They never do.</p>

      <p>The desert has claimed her. Not as a prisoner. But as a guardian.</p>

      <p>And when the wind howls at dusk, if you listen close—truly listen—you can hear her name in the storm.</p>

    <h2 class="npc-title">Of Sandstorms and Sidelong Grins</h2>
    <br>
    <section class="npc-story">
      <p>They weren’t expecting company. Not in the middle of the deep desert. Not with a sandstorm tearing the sky to ribbons behind them.</p>

      <p>Vash squinted up at the ridge, already raising a hand to shield his face. Dent stood unmoving beside him, unreadable as always, though the faint hum of his core pulsed slightly faster.</p>

      <p>"What the hell is that?" Vash muttered.</p>

      <p>And then she appeared—not walking, not running, but riding the storm itself.</p>

      <p>Her board, curved like a blade and gleaming with sun-polished steel, cut through the wall of wind and sand as if it had been forged from the desert itself. She surfed down the slope of the storm with perfect balance, a streak of motion and grit. A cloak snapped behind her like wings, and for a moment, she looked like a storm spirit given flesh.</p>

      <p>She hit the dune near them hard. The board dug into the sand, kicking up a tidal wave of grit that swallowed both Vash and Dent in an instant.</p>

      <p>"Godsdamn it!" Vash shouted, coughing and spitting.</p>

      <p>Dent said nothing, but turned his head slowly toward the cloud that had engulfed them.</p>

      <p>And then she strolled out of it.</p>

      <p>Sun-scorched skin, windswept hair, horns curved back like desert rock, and eyes like fire that hadn’t burned out. She wore a grin that didn’t care if you liked it, and a belt lined with tools, spare parts, and a flask that definitely didn’t hold water.</p>

      <p>"Whoops," she said, not sounding sorry in the slightest. Her voice was dry thunder.</p>

      <p>She gave Vash a once-over, winked.</p>

      <p>Then, with absolute confidence, she stepped up to Dent and kissed his cheekplate.</p>

      <p>"Nice plating."</p>

      <p>Without another word, she turned, kicked the board, and launched herself back into the storm, her laughter whipping through the wind like music from another world.</p>

      <p>They stood there in silence for a moment.</p>

      <p>Vash, still coughing, muttered, "What the hell just happened?"</p>

      <p>Dent’s hum normalized.</p>

      <p>"Style," he said.</p>

    <h2 class="npc-title">Of Boards, Blades, and the Velvet Mask</h2>
    <br>
    <section class="npc-story">
      <p>Sazhra wasn’t a city girl. The towering sandstone towers of Ember Spire made her itch. Too many corners. Too many people who couldn’t mind their own business.</p>

      <p>But she needed a new compression seal for the sandwake's core intake, and there was only one trader who carried it. So she came. And after two taverns, three back-alley merchants, and one fistfight over a mislabeled carburetor, she found herself pushing open the wrong door.</p>

      <p>A quiet space. Clean. Velvet draped over carved wood. Weapons on the walls, but elegant. Efficient.</p>

      <p>Wrong place.</p>

      <p>"Sorry," she said, already backing out. "Looking for a parts dealer. Took a wrong turn."</p>

      <p>"Wait."</p>

      <p>The voice stopped her. Smooth, sharp, curious. A woman stepped from the shadows with steps like silk over steel.</p>

      <p><strong>Shade.</strong></p>

      <p>She’d seen the board.</p>

      <p>"That yours?"</p>

      <p>Sazhra nodded.</p>

      <p>Shade crossed the room, inspecting it like a stolen artifact. "That’s a custom dune board. You tune this yourself?"</p>

      <p>"Every inch," Sazhra replied.</p>

      <p>"What’s it run on?"</p>

      <p>"Modified thaumic stabilizers. Dual-port ignition. Takes a little coaxing to keep it from flipping inside a vortex, but I like it mean."</p>

      <p>Shade raised an eyebrow. "Ever give lessons?"</p>

      <p>Sazhra smiled. "Not usually. But if you ever find me out there in the storm, I’ll show you how to ride."</p>

      <p>They left it at that. A brief moment. A flicker of connection between two women who understood speed, shadow, and silence.</p>

      <p>And when Shade watched her disappear into the crowd, board slung over her shoulder and horns gleaming in the firelight, she made a quiet note to keep an eye on the dunes.</p>

      <p>After all, you don’t meet the storm twice.</p>

      <p>Unless it wants you to.</p>

    <h1 class="npc-title">Tolla Jinxfuse – The Blistering Cauldron</h1>
    <br>
    <section class="npc-story">
      <p>Before the soot-streaked goggles and the singed eyebrows, before the explosions that made her neighbors scream and cheer in equal measure, Tolla Jinxfuse was a quiet forest gnome with a love for potions and plants. Born deep in the heart of Eltoria’s living wilds, her early life was one of bottled cures and whispered recipes passed down through careful hands. Her family had long been respected alchemists, known for healing draughts and salves that could soothe even the angriest worg bite or lull a fever-stricken child into sleep.</p>

      <p>Tolla, however, had a restless mind. Where others followed precise instructions, she made curious substitutions—soulroot instead of ironbark, a dash of starblossom where none was called for. Sometimes the results were brilliant. Sometimes they glowed green for a week and smelled of roasted onions. But always, always, she was creating.</p>

      <p>When she came of age, she was chosen to represent her family’s guild on a trade mission to Ember Spire, where her concoctions—cooling balms and wind-resistant tonics—were expected to fetch a fine price. But the desert city offered her more than coin. It offered her something far more intoxicating: the sound of fire meeting iron.</p>

      <p>She heard it first before she saw it—a thunderous crack in the distance that rolled through the stone alleys like laughter from a god. And when she arrived at the source, a cannon demonstration for some mercenary prince, she stood motionless, her wide eyes gleaming behind her spectacles. Gunpowder. Firearms. Explosives. It wasn’t just science. It was art.</p>

      <p>She never returned to Eltoria.</p>

      <p>Instead, she emptied her coinpurse, bought the small apothecary room she’d rented, and promptly blew out its windows experimenting with fire salts and powdered brimshade. The locals grumbled at first. Then they laughed. Then they started lining up to see what she’d invent next.</p>

      <p>Years later, her workshop—known unofficially as the Blistering Cauldron—sits precariously on a terrace overlooking Ember Spire’s lower docks, a haphazard tower of chimneys, gearwork, and rusted metal domes that cough out smoke and steam at all hours of the day. Inside, the tables are cluttered with half-melted schematics, sparking prototypes, and a growing collection of “failed” inventions that still rattle with unpredictable energy.</p>

      <p>Tolla is rarely seen without black powder stains on her gloves and a grin on her face. She’s designed rifles taller than she is, built cannons meant to test the limits of stone, and once turned a carriage into a rocket-propelled getaway cart. Her neighbors have long since stopped trying to guess what she’s working on. It’s safer that way.</p>

      <p>She speaks fondly of Eltoria, of the forests and soft winds and days spent foraging in peace. But she doesn’t miss it. “Potions are lovely,” she says, “but explosions are persuasive.” There’s something about the roar of invention and the thrill of controlled chaos that makes her feel more alive than any salve or elixir ever could.</p>

      <p>And deep down, Ember Spire knows: if something explodes just right—perfect shape, perfect sound, perfect scorch pattern—there’s a good chance Tolla Jinxfuse is behind it. Or under it. Or somewhere nearby, shouting “I meant to do that!” as smoke curls from her hair.</p>

    <h2 class="npc-title">Of Smoke, Sparks, and Things That Go Boom</h2>
    <br>
    <section class="npc-story">
      <p>The Ember Spire was no stranger to noise.</p>

      <p>It was a city that hummed with invention, cracked with flame, and sang with steel. You could hardly walk a block without a blast, a clang, or someone shouting about a gear gone rogue. But even by Ember Spire standards, this was excessive.</p>

      <p>Shade had just stepped into a quiet alley, fresh off a supply run for the guild—nothing urgent, nothing dangerous. She was halfway through a piece of candied ginger, the first quiet bite she’d had all day, when the wall next to her exploded.</p>

      <p>Not cracked. Not crumbled.</p>

      <p>Exploded.</p>

      <p>Bricks rained past her in a cloud of dust and copper-smelling smoke. Then—because chaos rarely travels alone—the next wall blew inward as well, as if to say, “Why stop at one?”</p>

      <p>Instinct took over. Shade was behind cover in a heartbeat, knives drawn, every muscle coiled. Was this a setup? A rival guild? One of those unhinged Spire fanatics trying to make a point with dynamite?</p>

      <p>The smoke shifted.</p>

      <p>A slow, heavy creak from inside the swirling gray. Footsteps. Big ones. No shape yet, just the vague silhouette stretching and twisting in the smoke like some massive beast dragging a warhammer. Shade tensed. Her breath slowed.</p>

      <p>The figure drew closer.</p>

      <p>Larger and larger, framed in soot and firelight, its jagged outline looming like a golem risen from the depths. Sparks snapped in the haze. The shadow raised one arm—massive, misshapen—</p>

      <p>And out of the smoke stepped…</p>

      <p>…a gnome.</p>

      <p>A very small gnome.</p>

      <p>Her boots were too big, her leather apron was half-scorched, and her goggles were cockeyed. A blackened wrench rested across her shoulder, longer than she was tall. Her hair jutted in ten directions, half-stuck with soot and half-vibrating with static.</p>

      <p>She looked around the destruction she had clearly caused and grinned wide enough to show a missing tooth.</p>

      <p>“Oh damn, that’ll need less nitrate next time,” she muttered, brushing ash from her sleeves like it was pollen.</p>

      <p>Then she saw Shade.</p>

      <p>The gnome froze.</p>

      <p>Shade didn’t move.</p>

      <p>The gnome’s eyes lit up behind the goggles. “Oh! Didn’t mean to vaporize anyone. You good?”</p>

      <p>Shade blinked. Just once.</p>

      <p>The gnome gave a proud salute with her smoldering wrench. “Name’s Tolla! Tolla Jinxfuse. You look nimble. Ever think about what a grappling cannon could do for you?”</p>

      <p>It wasn’t the pitch. It wasn’t even the explosions.</p>

      <p>It was the pure, unchecked delight in her voice. The giddy glee of someone who had just discovered what detonation felt like in her bones. Shade had known false madness. She’d met obsessed tinkerers, megalomaniacal artificers, even one bard who tried to weaponize a harp.</p>

      <p>But this? This was authentic.</p>

      <p>And Shade knew instantly—before the smoke had cleared, before the bricks had finished falling—that she needed this tiny chaos engine in her guild.</p>

      <p>Not just because she was dangerous.</p>

      <p>Because she was the best kind of dangerous.</p>

      <p>Later, Tolla would go on to provide some of the guild’s most hilariously effective solutions: exploding delivery pigeons, cannonball-sized tear gas mines, and later, largely the brainchild of the guild’s resident enchanter Selene Vale, a non-lethal landmine that shouted compliments when stepped on.</p>

      <p>But it all began here.</p>

      <p>With a shattered alley, a sugar-coated ginger dropped in the dust…</p>

      <p>…and a gnome-shaped silhouette giggling in a cloud of smoke.</p>

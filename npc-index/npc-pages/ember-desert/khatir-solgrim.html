    <h1 class="npc-title">Khatir Solgrim – The Mad Flame of Bastion Pyre</h1>
    <br>
    <section class="npc-story">
      <p>Khatir Solgrim was born into motion. Not the kind driven by curiosity or travel—but by the grinding, thunderous tread of the Titan itself. Bastion Pyre, the great dwarven forge-city that storms across the Ember Desert on eight mechanical legs, was his cradle, his school, his gods-damned battlefield. The rhythmic pounding of steel limbs on sand was his lullaby.</p>

      <p>His kin were smiths. Engineers. Salvagers. Every one of them bled iron and drank molten ambition. But even among the soot-faced and soot-souled, Khatir stood out. As a child, he was found sleeping inside a broken automaton, curled like a gemstone in its chest cavity. At age seven, he forged a dagger from the melted scrap of a shattered war golem. At ten, he lit his beard on fire just to test the heat resistance of his new ale recipe.</p>

      <p>He hasn’t spoken since.</p>

      <p>Not a word—not once. Some say it’s because of the fumes. Others swear he gave up speech because words are too slow for his brain. Whatever the reason, Khatir communicates in scowls, gestures, the occasional deranged cackle—and, of course, through the language of the forge.</p>

      <p>His work is unmistakable. Every weapon he makes glows—not with magic, but with heat. Raw, humming heat that never fades. Swords pulse like coals. Maces hiss like forge-bellows. One time he made a greataxe that screamed when swung. He called it "Melody." It is still embedded in a wall somewhere in Driftwake.</p>

      <p>He is rarely seen without his signature contraption: a jump pack fashioned from vulture wings, scavenged furnace jets, and repurposed mining pistons. It should not work. It does. When he descends from the sky in a burst of smoke and feathers, one might assume a demon has come to collect a debt.</p>

      <p>But then he lands. Laughs. Offers you a drink that smells like boiled gasoline. And points at your weapon like it’s personally offended him.</p>

      <p>Khatir drinks hard. Works harder. Flies only when it’s most dramatic. He finds joy in chaos, meaning in ruin, and art in every pile of junk. He’s beloved by the forge-priests, feared by bureaucrats, and adored by desert urchins who follow him like a flock of rust-covered birds.</p>

      <p>His forge within Bastion Pyre is both sacred and off-limits. A cathedral of flame and fury. He calls it "The Belly." Those lucky—or foolish—enough to step inside leave either sobbing with inspiration or running from something that should not have been given sentience.</p>

      <p>He will not talk to you. But if your hands know steel, and your heart knows fire—he might just nod.</p>

      <p>And if he nods, you’re family.</p>

    <br>
    <section class="npc-story">
      <p>The first time Vash stumbled across Bastion Pyre, it wasn’t on purpose.</p>

      <p>He’d been wandering the dunes, aimless in that familiar way that never truly was, when the ground began to shake. Not like an earthquake. Rhythmic. Purposeful. A mechanical heartbeat under the sand. Then came the shadow. A titan—no, The Titan. Eight-legged and thunder-footed, Bastion Pyre loomed like a walking mountain dragged from some dwarven fever dream.</p>

      <p>Vash stared.</p>

      <p>Then smiled.</p>

      <p>He followed.</p>

      <p>And that’s how he met Khatir Solgrim.</p>

      <p>The dwarf nearly brained him with a wrench the size of a broadsword when Vash tried to compliment his jump pack. But Vash had dealt with less-than-social types before. He stood his ground. Made a quip about the vulture wings. Got a grunt in response. From there, they reached a kind of understanding. Vash admired his work. Khatir didn't chase him off. In dwarf-speak, that was practically friendship.</p>

      <p>Years later, when Vash needed black powder and rare mod parts, there was only one place he trusted—and only one smith brutal enough to match his madness. He brought Dent along.</p>

      <p>It was Dent’s first time seeing the Tread Titan.</p>

      <p>His first time watching a city breathe—steam hissing from massive pistons, scrapwork sentinels shifting with eerie grace, forge-chimneys coughing light into the dusk. Every wall, every street, every market stall was made from salvaged war machines and half-forgotten tech. Dent stood still for almost an hour, awestruck. He didn’t speak. Just watched. Listened. Felt.</p>

      <p>When they found Khatir, the dwarf scowled, arms crossed, wings twitching with suspicion.</p>

      <p>Then he saw Dent.</p>

      <p>And smiled. A rare, molten-glow sort of smile.</p>

      <p>They spoke. Not in Common. Not even in Dwarvish. But in a language of clicks and nods, of mechanical gestures and half-muttered phrases, thick with context and craft. Where others heard grunts, Dent heard symphonies. Where others saw chaos, he saw blueprints. They debated internal pressure chambers. Argled over arc-twist tolerances. Spoke of cannon cores, burnt rune matrices, and the ethics of reusing sanctified construct hearts.</p>

      <p>Vash watched it all with quiet amusement. Two builders. One body. One born of metal. One born to wield it.</p>

      <p>For all Khatir’s silence, he was talkative around Dent. He explained things. Drew diagrams. Brought out his prototypes. They drank together too—disgusting brews that burned like rusted lightning—and traded notes on reforging history.</p>

      <p>Since then, Dent has looked forward to returning to Bastion Pyre to speak with Khatir. The dwarf doesn’t speak to many. Doesn’t trust many. But with Dent, he doesn’t need to.</p>

      <p>They speak in sparks. In scars. In steel.</p>

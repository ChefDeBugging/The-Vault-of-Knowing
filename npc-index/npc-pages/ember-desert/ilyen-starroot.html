    <h1 class="npc-title">Ilyen Starroot – Wandering Herbalist</h1>
    <br>
    <section class="npc-story">
      <p>Ilyen Starroot was not made for marble halls and structured syllabi.</p>

      <p>Born in the Celestial Highlands, she spent her earliest years among spires of gleaming stone and perfumed gardens that bloomed in perfect symmetry. Her talent for alchemy was undeniable—even as a child, she could brew remedies that rivaled seasoned healers. It was only natural she be enrolled in the Citadel’s prestigious alchemical program. And for a time, she tried.</p>

      <p>But the Citadel moved too slow. Too straight. Ilyen wanted to wander. Wanted to hum while she worked, to dance while she distilled. She dropped out before she could be told not to, packed up her vials, and followed the wind.</p>

      <p>It led her to the Ironwood first, where the trees whispered secrets too old for books. Then on to the Ember Desert, where stories clung to the sand and rare plants dared to bloom where they shouldn’t. She fell in love with the challenge, with the freedom, and with the barefoot feeling of the warm earth beneath her toes.</p>

      <p>Now, she roams the sands with a satchel full of clinking glass and aromatic chaos. In Khazad al Sahra’s open-air bazaar, she sells brews that fizz, glow, whisper, and occasionally explode. Locals call her eccentric. Travelers call her a miracle worker. Ilyen just calls it fun.</p>

      <p>She never stopped learning. Just chose a different classroom. One with no walls, and with sun-warmed dunes for desks.</p>

    <h2 class="npc-title">Of Humming Tunes and Shared Roots</h2>
    <br>
    <section class="npc-story">
      <p>It began with a tune.</p>

      <p>Shade had passed by the stall many times. Ilyen Starroot was a reliable source of strange ingredients, unmarked brews, and incense that either calmed the nerves or made you speak fluent gibberish for hours. Most called her strange. Some called her brilliant. Shade called her useful.</p>

      <p>But this time, Shade wasn’t alone.</p>

      <p>Zostara lingered a step behind, letting her friend haggle over powdered fireblossom and a vial of glowing spore extract. Her attention wasn’t on the trade, but on the faint melody threading through the bazaar’s bustle. Ilyen hummed as she worked, barefoot as always, her toes nestled in sun-warmed sand, a wreath of dried herbs tangled in her silver-streaked hair.</p>

      <p>Zostara knew the tune.</p>

      <p>It wasn’t common here—not in the bazaar of Khazad al Sahra, far from the whispering shores of the Twilight Isles. But the melody rang clear in her memory, a lullaby once sung on wind-charmed balconies, where night-blooms opened to moonlight.</p>

      <p>"Where did you learn that song?" Zostara asked.</p>

      <p>Ilyen looked up, blinking. "This one? Oh, just a little thing I picked up. A bard passed through a while back, sang it like the stars were listening. I thought it pretty."</p>

      <p>Zostara smiled. "It’s from my home."</p>

      <p>"Well then," Ilyen said brightly, handing her a flask of something fizzy and fuchsia, "you’ve got good taste in home and in harmonies."</p>

      <p>That was all it took.</p>

      <p>They spent hours talking. About the Citadel, about the professors who droned on like drying paint, about recipes both magical and culinary. Ilyen, who had wandered out of academia in search of more fragrant horizons. Zostara, who had danced between structure and spirit all her life.</p>

      <p>Shade watched with her usual quiet observation. She knew Ilyen, but only in the way most people did: a transactional connection with the occasional cryptic charm thrown in. But Zostara saw more.</p>

      <p>Saw the mirth behind the murmurs. The brilliance behind the barefoot strolls.</p>

      <p>By the end of the day, Zostara had a pouch full of potions, a new friend, and a vow to return.</p>

      <p>And Ilyen? She had someone to share her desert blooms with.</p>

      <p>Not everything had to be brewed in glass and fire.</p>

      <p>Some bonds grew like wildflowers—unexpected, untrimmed, and perfectly timed.</p>

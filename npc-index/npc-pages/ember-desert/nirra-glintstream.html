    <br>
    <section class="npc-story">
      <p>There are some homes so full of warmth, they seem to breathe. Nirra Glintstream was born in one.</p>

      <p>Tucked among the gentle fields of Eltoria, in a cottage that always smelled of rosemary and rising bread, Nirra grew up with flour on her cheeks and laughter in her ears. Her parents—an endlessly cheerful pair of halflings—raised her and her siblings with full bellies and fuller hearts. Her mother sang as she cooked, stirring pots with magic woven in joy. Her father taught them to coax sweetness from the soil and stories from the grain. Together, they grew meals that tasted like memory, like childhood, like love.</p>

      <p>From the moment she could reach the counter, Nirra was stirring, kneading, slicing. Not with ambition, but with delight. Food wasn’t just nourishment—it was art, comfort, connection. A language that needed no translation. And when she spoke it, people listened. Smiles deepened. Troubles softened. It was magic, just not the flashy kind.</p>

      <p>Still, when she came of age and announced she wanted to share their recipes with the world, her parents frowned. The world, after all, was big. Dangerous. Unkind to halflings with starry dreams and sauce-stained aprons. But Nirra just smiled and hugged them tight. “I’ll be careful,” she said. “But I have to go. There’s a whole world out there that hasn’t tried Mama’s honey-braised fennel.”</p>

      <p>And so, with a satchel full of spice jars and a heart full of courage, she left the comfort of her fields and headed for the one place where trade never slept: the Ember Desert.</p>

      <p>Driftwake, the southern port town of Ember Desert, greeted her with sand, bustle, and an ocean breeze thick with spice. She found a crooked little building near the docks, patched it up with charm and elbow grease, and opened her doors to the world.</p>

      <p>They came in slow, at first. Curious dockworkers. Travelers missing home. Then merchants. Then nobles. Then everyone. Word spread like butter melting on warm bread—there was a place in Driftwake where the food felt like being hugged by someone who remembered your name. And just like that, Nirra Glintstream became a legend.</p>

      <p>Trade boomed through Driftwake. Ships rerouted their entire courses just to dock near her tavern. She became wealthy—embarrassingly so, by halfling standards—but never proud. Just grateful. And hungry for more.</p>

      <p>Not wealth. Not fame.</p>

      <p>Just kitchens.</p>

      <p>More places to cook. More people to feed. More stories to season her food with.</p>

      <p>So she expanded. A location in Ember Spire, for the wanderers who’d forgotten how joy tastes. One in every major port city across the continent, each with its own menu shaped by the region but always grounded in the comfort food of her youth. Even the Empire of Tides welcomed her with open arms—and open mouths.</p>

      <p>Now, Nirra spends her days traveling between her restaurants, tasting new dishes, learning from her chefs, and sprinkling her quiet magic wherever she goes. No matter how high her name rises in culinary circles, she still wears the same patchy apron, still tastes every sauce herself, still believes that no feast is complete without laughter echoing off the walls.</p>

      <p>To some, she’s an icon.</p>

      <p>To others, a mystery.</p>

      <p>But to those who’ve tasted her cooking, Nirra Glintstream is something far rarer.</p>

      <p>She’s home.</p>

    <h2 class="npc-title">Of Salt, Soot, and Second Chances</h2>
    <br>
    <section class="npc-story">
      <p>The desert wind didn’t care who you were. It scoured all the same—rich or poor, guilty or innocent. And when it sank into your bones, it stayed. Just like pain. Just like memory.</p>

      <p>Vash had been running for days. Not from one thing, but many: mistakes, debts, shadows that used to have names. His boots were cracked, his coat stiff with dust, and his stomach had long since stopped growling. It didn’t see the point.</p>

      <p>He hadn’t meant to stop in Driftwake. Just another town. Another place to duck into alleys and dodge eye contact. But something pulled him through the dockside market—something warm, something sharp and sweet in the air. A smell that hit him harder than any bounty hunter ever had.</p>

      <p>Food.</p>

      <p>Real food.</p>

      <p>Not trail rations or stolen scraps. Not the desperate kind eaten on the move. This was comfort. Welcome. Home.</p>

      <p>He followed it on instinct. Limped through the market, past the perfume stalls and spice sellers, until he found it: a squat little building with flowers in the window boxes and laughter leaking through the shutters.</p>

      <p>He hesitated at the door. He looked like hell. Worse, he felt like it.</p>

      <p>Then the door opened before he could knock.</p>

      <p>She was shorter than he expected. Round-cheeked, flour-dusted, eyes full of sunlight even in the shade. She looked him over once—not long enough to judge, just long enough to see.</p>

      <p>Then she smiled.</p>

      <p>“You look like you need a table.”</p>

      <p>Before he could speak, she’d guided him in, seated him by the window, and vanished into the kitchen. Minutes later, the table was full: roasted root pie, buttered bread, spiced tea, a bowl of something so fragrant it made his throat ache just smelling it.</p>

      <p>No questions.</p>

      <p>No side-eyes.</p>

      <p>Just food. And for the first time in weeks, peace.</p>

      <p>When he’d eaten his fill—and then some—she brought out a towel, a basin, and a change of clothes that somehow fit. She didn’t mention the cuts on his knuckles or the blood on his cuffs. Just pointed to the back room with a wink and said, “There’s hot water and a place to breathe. Use both.”</p>

      <p>He stayed two nights.</p>

      <p>The second morning, he woke to find her humming at the register, counting coin with practiced ease. She handed him a folded note and a tiny pouch of silver. “Paid off your bounty,” she said, like it was nothing more than restocking an herb shelf. “Turns out, the magistrate’s a sucker for my lemon tart.”</p>

      <p>He stared, stunned.</p>

      <p>She shrugged. “You’ve got good eyes. Sad ones, but honest. I don’t ask stories, but I am good at reading people. You needed help. That’s all I need to know.”</p>

      <p>He tried to thank her.</p>

      <p>She stopped him with a raised hand. “Just leave an honest review. And if you’re ever back in Driftwake—hungry, hunted, or just tired—you’ve got a table. You’ve got a room.”</p>

      <p>Vash nodded. Words didn’t work right then.</p>

      <p>But later, when he was stronger, when the world felt less cruel, he’d think back to that kitchen. To the smell of rosemary and roasted garlic. To the woman who didn’t flinch when the storm blew in. To the quiet kindness that didn’t ask for redemption—just trust.</p>

      <p>And he’d smile.</p>

      <p>Because sometimes, the world does give second chances.</p>

      <p>And sometimes, they come with pie.</p>

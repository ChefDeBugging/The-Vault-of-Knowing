    <br>
    <section class="npc-story">
      <p>The desert doesn’t raise the gentle.</p>

      <p>Quen Maddrek was born beneath a sky that cracked with heat and silence, somewhere between nowhere and nowhere else in the Ember Desert. No village marked his birth. No midwife caught his first breath. His earliest memory was of sand, hot and endless, and the way it bit back when you dared to rest.</p>

      <p>He learned the dunes like a second skin. Learned which snakes wouldn’t wait for you to blink, and how to sip water from stones that looked too dry to weep. He wasn’t raised; he survived. And when he finally stumbled into Stonewind as a ragged teenager, small and sharp-eyed and sunburnt to hell, he was less a boy and more a question: “What do I do with all this fire?”</p>

      <p>Stonewind—harsh, carved into rock, kissed by winds that howled like angry gods—gave him an answer.</p>

      <p>The dwarves there didn’t much care for orphans or gnomes. But they did care for results. And Quen? He was curious. He was relentless. And most importantly, he was loud. He learned their powder tricks in half the time they expected, then started improving them in ways they didn’t. By the time they called him “boy,” he was already detonating sandstone cliffs with shaped charges made from discarded ale barrels and scorpion venom.</p>

      <p>But it wasn’t just the dwarves who shaped him. The goliath herds that roamed the high ridges above Stonewind became his accidental mentors. They were giants made of leather and legend, all muscle and ritual. He was a gnome with soot on his cheeks and a wicked grin. It shouldn’t have worked.</p>

      <p>But it did.</p>

      <p>They brawled in the red dust, laughing like thunder as he darted under their legs, scaled their backs, and knocked them flat with flash-bangs and elbow jabs they never saw coming. He weighed less than their thighbones, but they started calling him “The Ember Howl”—because when he fought, he didn’t stop, and he always announced himself with a bang.</p>

      <p>Now grown and grinning wider than ever, Quen makes his living doing what he loves: planning the impossible and blowing it up afterward. He doesn’t rob people. He just makes things… rearrange. Vaults. Caravans. Fortresses. If it holds gold and pays well enough, he’ll figure out how to make it disappear—or at least stop belonging to whoever thought it did.</p>

      <p>His heist plans are legendary. Detailed. Precise. Elegant, even. His explosives? Beautifully chaotic. A symphony of fire and timing. He never sets off a charge without triple-checking every fuse and escape route. But when things go wrong—and they do, often—he’s already halfway through explaining why it was “part of the plan” before the dust even settles.</p>

      <p>He doesn’t brag much. He doesn’t need to.</p>

      <p>The fireworks speak for him.</p>

      <p>And if you ever find yourself near Stonewind and hear something booming across the cliffs, don’t panic.</p>

      <p>It’s probably just Quen.</p>

      <p>Doing what he does best.</p>

      <p>And maybe explaining it later.</p>

    <section class="npc-story">
      <p>They called him the Ember Howl.</p>

      <p>And Meebs—barely out of her first real year in the ring—wanted nothing more than to beat him.</p>

      <p>Her herd had passed through Stonewind many times before, trading goods and sparring stories with the dwarves and goliaths. But this time was different. This time, Meebs had earned the right to challenge. She was big now. Strong. She had scars to show and elders nodding when she walked past.</p>

      <p>And she wanted to test her strength against a legend.</p>

      <p>She expected a monster.</p>

      <p>She got a gnome.</p>

      <p>Barely came up to her ribs. Grinning like a lunatic. Covered in soot, hair singed on one side, goggles pushed up over one brow. “So,” he said, bouncing on his heels, “you’re the goliath they said was dumb enough to fight me.”</p>

      <p>Meebs blinked. “You’re the Ember Howl?”</p>

      <p>“In the flesh,” he said. “Want to find out what kind of crater you make?”</p>

      <p>She did.</p>

      <p>And she lost.</p>

      <p>Badly.</p>

      <p>Not for lack of strength—gods knew she hit hard—but because Quen fought like a lightning storm in a box of fireworks. He didn’t wrestle. He ricocheted. He shouted commands to invisible constructs and lit fuses as he dodged her swings. At one point she was pretty sure he’d vanished entirely, only to reappear with a handful of dirt and a bomb made out of a teacup.</p>

      <p>When it was over, she was smoking, coughing, and flat on her back, blinking up at the sky with a dumb grin.</p>

      <p>She hated it.</p>

      <p>And she never forgot it.</p>

      <p>But Quen didn’t boast. Didn’t mock her. He just handed her a drink—something fermented and too spicy—and said, “You held out longer than most. Want to go blow up a mountain?”</p>

      <p>She did.</p>

      <p>They spent the rest of the day clambering up one of the nearby peaks, stuffing powder into cracks, arguing about blast angles, and laughing way too hard when the entire ridge face came crashing down like a dying god. They didn’t talk about dreams. Or families. Or fears.</p>

      <p>Just rocks.</p>

      <p>And how best to break them.</p>

      <p>It was simple. Stupid. Loud. Beautiful.</p>

      <p>Meebs had many battles ahead. Many burdens to carry. The weight of the herd would settle heavy on her shoulders soon enough.</p>

      <p>But for one day, she got to be wild.</p>

      <p>Not a warrior. Not a leader. Just a girl with dirt on her face and dynamite in her hands, trying to out-blast a gnome who seemed made of chaos and caffeine.</p>

      <p>And when she thinks back on it now—older, wearier, carved up by war and time—she smiles.</p>

      <p>Because some memories don’t need purpose.</p>

      <p>Some just need noise.</p>

      <p>And Quen Maddrek was very, very good at noise.</p>

    <h1 class="npc-title">Kess Tal’Ren – The Healer Between Worlds</h1>
    <br>
    <section class="npc-story">
      <p>Born beneath the sighing boughs of the Eltorian wilds, Kess Tal’Ren entered the world in shadow and silence. His parents, poachers by trade, were not welcome in the living wilds, and the forest did what it must. But the forest is not cruel. It is balance incarnate, and the child could not be blamed for the sins of his blood.</p>

      <p>Rather than strike him down, the wilds delivered him to a halfling caravan that had made temporary camp beneath the shade of the elder trees. The halflings, ever warm-hearted and curious, took the infant in without hesitation. They returned to their nomadic homeland: a great city built upon the back of an ancient turtle, whose shell bore trees, homes, and gathering spaces like a drifting island.</p>

      <p>It was not a city by most standards—no walls, no towers, no rigid hierarchy. But to the people of Eltoria, it was a marvel of cooperation, a place where the land and its people breathed in rhythm. Kess was raised by all of them. A true village child. He learned to speak to the trees, to listen to the sway of moss when it warned of storms, and to follow the scent of healing roots through the fog. The village raised him to be many things, but above all: kind, precise, and wise.</p>

      <p>Even so, curiosity tugged at him.</p>

      <p>The wider world called. And with a pack of salves and seeds, Kess ventured beyond Eltoria, walking the realms with the calm pace of someone who knew home would always welcome him back.</p>

      <p>He healed the wounded in mountain wars. He comforted the dying on plague-ships drifting through swamps. He brewed remedies in city gutters, under starlit canopies, beside ancient temples. His skill became legend in some corners of the world, though he never sought reputation.</p>

      <p>Then came Aeliana Ael'tharis.</p>

      <p>A Shadar-Kai from the Twilight Isles, whose voice sang like wind through bone and whose touch was cool as starlight. They met by accident—or fate—while both tending to the same wounded knight, though on opposite sides of a forgotten skirmish. Her name is not spoken lightly in Eltoria now, for she is the first of her kind to enter the realm and not be swallowed by it.</p>

      <p>And this is not because of power, or prophecy.</p>

      <p>It is because Kess Tal’Ren loves her.</p>

      <p>And the land, as always, recognizes love when it sees it.</p>

      <p>Now he moves between worlds—the dream-washed silence of the Twilight Isles, and the breathing green of Eltoria. He is a bridge not just of nations, but of spirits. And though his hands are lined with age and his face rarely smiles, there is a quiet peace in him that few can match.</p>

      <p>The forest once spared his life.</p>

      <p>Now he returns the favor, again and again, wherever healing is needed.</p>

    <h2 class="npc-title">Of Lakeside Fires and Impossible Paths</h2>
    <br>
    <section class="npc-story">
      <p>The day Aeliana returned to the Twilight Isles with Kess Tal’Ren in tow was one of celebration—the kind of rare, joyous gathering that made the dusklit forests hum with song and the lake sparkle like a thousand quiet stars.</p>

      <p>Aeliana had been gone for a long while, and her return with a fiancé from another realm stirred curiosity and excitement alike. A lakeside fire was built. Food was cooked with too much spice and just enough love. Someone brought a lute that only played in moonlight. Meebs found herself drawn into the festivities despite her usual distance, pulled in by the warmth of the crowd and the crackling laughter rising from the flames.</p>

      <p>That’s when Kess first spoke to her.</p>

      <p>He was fascinated—not in the awkward, wide-eyed way of outsiders, but with the open curiosity of someone who had never stopped wondering how the world worked. He had only ever met one Goliath before, briefly and under far different circumstances, and now here was Meebs, larger than life and calmly nursing a spiced drink by the fire.</p>

      <p>He introduced himself politely, then asked about her thoughts on the moons’ colors. Not her tribe. Not her strength. The moons.</p>

      <p>It was the right question.</p>

      <p>They talked. Slowly at first. Then with ease. Aeliana joined them not long after, and the three spent the rest of the evening trading stories and jokes, slipping into a kind of camaraderie that needed no effort. They played games carved into the sand, dared one another into telling embarrassing tales, and danced like the night had forgotten how to pass.</p>

      <p>Kess made a point to speak to Meebs again before the fire burned low. He told her she was welcome in his village anytime. That if she ever stepped foot in Eltoria, she’d have a place to stay, meals to eat, and family waiting to meet her.</p>

      <p>The next day, he and Aeliana left for the wilds.</p>

      <p>A week later, Meebs vanished from the Twilight Isles.</p>

      <p>But she still remembers that fire. The warmth. The music. The way he described his home—perched atop the shell of a living mountain, always moving, always alive.</p>

      <p>And somewhere in her pack, carefully wrapped in cloth, is the wedding invitation he gave her.</p>

      <p>Spring, he had said.</p>

      <p>She wonders if the turtle still roams.</p>

      <p>And if the fire still burns.</p>

    <h1 class="npc-title">Dorus Kel – Where the Dead Things Grow</h1>
    <br>
    <section class="npc-story">
      <p>The soil of Eltoria is alive—but not all life is kind.</p>

      <p>Out past the whispering vines and silver-leafed groves, where the wind doesn’t sing but hisses, there lies a patch of land best left unnamed. The air smells like copper and burnt fennel. The ground moves when it shouldn’t. And there, in this quiet rot of a garden, Dorus Kel tends his crops.</p>

      <p>Blight crops. Death flowers. Thornroot. Widow’s bloom. Hollow vine. The kinds of plants that bite, strangle, or release a puff of spores that can paralyze a yak in mid-bellow.</p>

      <p>To Dorus, though, they’re just family.</p>

      <p>He was born on a blight farm, raised between fields that hungered for blood and trellises that whispered threats at dusk. His parents were legends in the poisoner’s trade, and they taught him everything—how to seed the carrion beds, how to harvest without losing a limb, how to speak softly to the hate-thistle so it didn’t combust from spite.</p>

      <p>They passed in their sleep, as most halflings never do, and Dorus buried them beneath the same patch of marrowgrass they had once planted together. It was peaceful. Fitting.</p>

      <p>But Dorus did something they never had the chance—or the nerve—to do.</p>

      <p>He left.</p>

      <p>He didn’t abandon the farm, of course. It still thrives, venomous and violent, deep in the wilds of Eltoria. But Dorus carved a new path through the thorns, one that led to Embertide, where sun met sea and poison had value beyond the leaf.</p>

      <p>He opened a storefront—quiet, modest, hidden just enough to avoid the wrong kind of interest. His brother minds it when he’s not off sailing the tide routes, trading antitoxins to corsairs and thieves who appreciate their purity. Dorus makes the trip every third day, hauling crates of wiltleaf tonic and corpseberry extract under heavy cloth, taking in the salt air and the lull of waves.</p>

      <p>To most, he’s an unsettling little man. Pale, terse, eyes like river pebbles.</p>

      <p>But to those who know what a blackrose bloom is worth—or how many lives a drip of siphonroot sap can save—Dorus Kel is indispensable.</p>

      <p>He doesn’t smile much. The thorns don’t like it when he does.</p>

      <p>But he walks the line between life and death like someone who knows both personally.</p>

      <p>And in a way, he does.</p>  
      <p>>He’s grown them. Watered them.</p>
      <p>Buried them.</p>  
      <p>And sold them by the bundle.</p>

    <h2 class="npc-title">Of Thorny Deals and Bitter Roots</h2>
    <br>
    <section class="npc-story">
      <p>When word reached Shade that a blight farmer had opened shop in Embertide, she dropped her teacup mid-sip.</p>

      <p>It wasn’t disbelief—it was relief.</p>

      <p>For years, Shade had relied on Captain Maxwell to ferry her poisons and antidotes from the deep wilds of Eltoria, the only route into the Kel family farm that didn’t end in a slow and unpleasant death. The problem was Maxwell’s sense of time. A “quick jaunt” could spiral into a month-long excursion involving pirates, smugglers, and at least one sea kraken. Shade had learned to stockpile like a siege was coming.</p>

      <p>But now? The blight was coming to her.</p>

      <p>Three days by skiff was nothing compared to the logistical nightmare she used to endure. She arrived at the storefront in Embertide before the ink on the “OPEN” sign had fully dried.</p>

      <p>She had never met Dorus. Never even glimpsed the infamous halfling poisoner who'd grown her favorite paralytic blooms. But he knew her well. His parents had spoken of her often—how she’d cleared out an entire assassination ring in the Highlands with a single drop of nightshade resin. How she always paid double, asked smart questions, and never tried to haggle.</p>

      <p>When she entered the shop, lined with jars of quiet death and bottled salvation, Dorus smiled a smile like a dry leaf cracking in the wind.</p>

      <p>"Thought you might stop by," he said.</p>

      <p>Shade didn’t speak right away. She just walked the room, running her fingers along twisted vines sealed in glass, tiny flowers with teeth, and powders that shimmered with promise or threat. Then she turned to him and dropped a pouch heavy with coin onto the counter.</p>

      <p>"An extra thousand," she said. "To make sure this place lasts."</p>

      <p>Dorus didn’t argue. He knew better than to reject good investments. Instead, he handed her a vial of whisperroot extract—a poison so silent it didn’t even register as pain—and a small, unmarked bottle.</p>

      <p>"For when things get loud," he said.</p>

      <p>And so began a quiet arrangement.</p>

      <p>Whenever she returned, he had something waiting—elixirs that saved her life, poisons that ended others’. Shade never asked how he knew what she’d need. Dorus never asked why she needed it.</p>

      <p>Their trade was rooted in deeper soil than trust.  
      It was mutual understanding. A shared respect for the delicate balance between death and necessity.</p>

      <p>And besides, she’d once called his poison shelf “poetry in glass.”  
      He’d never admit it, but that meant a great deal.</p>

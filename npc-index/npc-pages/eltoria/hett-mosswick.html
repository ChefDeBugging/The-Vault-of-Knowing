    <h1 class="npc-title">Hett Mosswick – Roots Beneath the Fur</h1>
    <br>
    <section class="npc-story">
      <p>In the dense breath of Eltoria’s green heart, where trees walk and flowers whisper warnings, there grew a firbolg child with moss on her back and dirt in her smile. Hett Mosswick. Daughter of the wilds. Speaker of the Verdant Tongue.</p>

      <p>She was raised not by a single grove, but by all of them. Her parents, both druids, taught her the true songs of the forest—not the chants of mortal spells, but the patient lullabies sung between wind and root. She listened, learned, and answered. Even the fanged vines that shred flesh from bone in Eltoria’s deeper glades bowed gently when she passed.</p>

      <p>To most, Eltoria is a forbidden realm—a place where the land itself is alive, alert, and merciless to outsiders. But to Hett, it is home. She has walked its ever-shifting trails since she could crawl, speaking with blooms that change color with emotion and brooks that hide their true names. And when poachers scar its skin or fools try to tame its feral grace, she is there. Healing. Restoring. Reminding.</p>

      <p>Her body reflects that bond. Moss grows freely across her fur, tended like a living quilt of forest memory. A sapling—once a dying oak sprout—now grows from the arch of her left horn, tiny branches dancing with seasonal leaves. Her voice carries the hush of rainfall through leaves and the rumble of ancient soil. Her scent is pine, dew, and green things dreaming.</p>

      <p>She is a druid of few words, but boundless presence.</p>

      <p>Though she loves the wilds, she is no recluse. In the furnace of Ember Spire, surrounded by brass towers and desert wind, Hett Mosswick keeps a shop.</p>

      <p>"The Stillgrove Apothecary," it is called.</p>

      <p>A humble name for a place of wonder.</p>

      <p>She is there but rarely—one, maybe two days a week—just long enough to restock and dispense. The rest of her time is spent gathering: negotiating with territorial fungi, attending to sickly trees, calming quarrels between jealous herbs. Every vial on her shelf is a pact, every salve a story.</p>

      <p>Her concoctions are not cheap. Nor should they be.</p>

      <p>They carry the spirit of Eltoria within them—and the trust of a land that does not forgive easily.</p>

      <p>Travelers speak of her with awe, sometimes fear. Locals whisper that she once healed a man poisoned by ghost nettle simply by whispering to the leaf that stung him, asking it to take its pain back. Others claim the shop itself is alive, shifting its interior when no one is looking, blooming fresh blossoms where none were before.</p>

      <p>But Hett does not seek fame. She walks the line between realms as a caretaker, not a merchant. A healer. A bridge between the civilized and the untamed.</p>

      <p>And though the city changes and the forest grows wild, she remains steady.</p>

      <p>Moss on her shoulders. Roots in her blood. And the whisper of leaves forever in her wake.</p>

    <section class="npc-story">
      <p>Shade had a habit of noticing patterns.</p>

      <p>She’d pass the shop each morning—always the same time, always the same pace. Sometimes it was shuttered, sometimes not. When it was open, the air spilled with scent: rain-soaked bark, citrus crushed underfoot, something like memory, something like home. Shade didn’t know the name at first. She only knew what Captain Maxwell had told her in passing—that a Firbolg woman from the wilds of Eltoria had taken up part-time residence in Ember Spire, bringing with her herbs too wild for most hands to touch.</p>

      <p>Hett Mosswick.</p>

      <p>It wasn’t just the name. It was what she brought with her. The apothecary, unassuming at a glance, shimmered with the hum of old life. Roots dangled from woven baskets. Flowers blinked open as you passed. A jar labeled "Thistle’s Spite" occasionally shifted locations on its own. Shade was intrigued. Enough to adjust her entire morning route.</p>

      <p>Eventually, she caught her.</p>

      <p>Hett was taller than expected, stooped only slightly from time—not weakness. Moss clung to her fur in soft patches, and one of her horns had grown into a gnarled little tree, complete with tiny blossoms that pulsed faintly with magic. She didn’t greet Shade with questions. Just a smile. A knowing nod. An offered vial of something green and glowing.</p>

      <p>Shade took it. Used it that night. And walked out of a trap alive.</p>

      <p>Zostara came along on the next visit. At first, she lingered—curious, unsure. But Hett had a way of folding people into warmth without forcing them near. She spoke to Zostara like one would speak to a curious stream—gently, with interest. Before long, Zostara was asking questions about sap veins and the dream-vines of the lower glades. Hett answered each one, often with a strange flower plucked from a wooden drawer. “This one will let you sing with the wind,” she said once. Another, she warned, would cause uncontrollable laughter if steeped in tea.</p>

      <p>But it wasn’t just whimsy. The tonics worked.</p>

      <p>One gave Zostara a voice that melted suspicion like wax—just in time for a sticky encounter with a High Elven emissary.</p>

      <p>Another let Shade leap higher than any mortal had right to. She used it to vault a fortress wall and end a dark wizard before he could complete the incantation.</p>

      <p>And each time, Hett would only smile and say, "The wilds told me you’d need it."</p>

      <p>Her words were slow, deliberate. Woven like vines rather than spoken like speech. She never asked for thanks. Never charged for the truly strange gifts. She said the plants chose.</p>

      <p>One day, as they prepared to leave, she said something that stayed with them both.</p>

      <p>"Your bond," she said, eyes glinting with deep earth wisdom, "is known to the wilds. If ever you come to Eltoria, and the woods know your heart to be kind, they will not harm you. They will know you by your root. And they will let you pass."</p>

      <p>She never said farewell. Hett Mosswick simply turned, whispered to a jar of leaves, and let the silence grow.</p>

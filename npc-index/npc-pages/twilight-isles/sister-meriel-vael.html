    <br>
    <section class="story-section">
      <p>There are those who follow gods out of fear. Others, out of need.</p>

      <p>But Meriel Vael was born with devotion already burning in her chest.</p>

      <p>She came into the world during the second Dawn Cycle—when the skies still rippled gold at morning and the Kalashtar sang softly of the stars. Even then, as a child, she would wander the cliffs and talk to the wind, whispering prayers no one taught her. She spoke of Lysera long before she was taught the name. “The Light Between,” she called her. “The Mother of Dreams.” Some thought her touched by prophecy. Others feared she might drift too far into the realm of visions.</p>

      <p>She never did.</p>

      <p>Her path was never one of chaos. It was clarity wrapped in clouds.</p>

      <p>While others struggled with doubt or wandered between beliefs, Meriel walked straight into the heart of the divine and never once looked back. She studied the rites. Mastered the chants. Carried the dawnflame with calm and poise through every sacred hall of the Twilight Isles. She never married, never traveled far. Her temple was enough. The sky, a cathedral.</p>

      <p>She has aged, yes—but it is not the brittle aging of mortal decay. It is the soft silvering of time around someone who has already found her center. Her hair flows like riverlight. Her hands are weathered but never weak. Her voice, when it rises in hymn, can still bring soldiers to their knees and children to quiet wonder.</p>

      <p>And through it all, she has remained Lysera’s most steadfast vessel.</p>

      <p>There are whispers that Sister Meriel can speak directly to the goddess—that her dreams are not merely dreams, but audiences. That she once walked barefoot through a field of ash and came out with moonlight etched across her skin. That she knows the date of her own death, and welcomes it like an old friend she once blessed as a baby.</p>

      <p>She never confirms these stories.</p>

      <p>But she never denies them, either.</p>

      <p>Her sermons are soft, drifting things—half riddles, half lullabies. “The light will find you,” she often says. “But first, you must become still enough to be found.” Some priests recite doctrine. Meriel offers stories. Lessons layered in parable and possibility. Her followers say that you don’t understand her fully until weeks later, when a phrase she spoke reappears in your dreams, exactly when you need it.</p>

      <p>She is kindness woven with discipline. A warm hand offered with the expectation that you will rise. She does not coddle, but she does not condemn. Her faith is not blind—it is blinding. A lighthouse, not a torch.</p>

      <p>When you speak to her, it feels as if she is watching your soul more than your face.</p>

      <p>And if she ever closes her eyes mid-conversation, it is not sleep.</p>

      <p>It is listening.</p>

      <p>Because Lysera still whispers to her.</p>

      <p>And Sister Meriel Vael still listens.</p>

      <p>Zostara first heard the name Sister Meriel Vael whispered through temple halls long before she ever met her. In the Twilight Isles, Meriel’s name carried weight—not with the clanging of titles, but with the hush of reverence. She was the flame that never flickered. The voice that could still a storm.</p>

      <p>When Zostara was a student, her classes occasionally brought her to the temple where Sister Meriel resided. At first, she didn’t stand out. Just another Kalashtar girl with questions in her eyes and more interest in the sky than the scripture.</p>

      <p>But Meriel noticed her.</p>

      <p>She always noticed.</p>

      <p>There was something about Zostara that made the old priestess pause. The girl was born outside the Dawn Cycle, and yet… she shimmered with it. There was a rhythm to her spirit that beat like sunrise. Meriel called it a paradox. Quietly. Gently. As if speaking it aloud too boldly might cause the stars themselves to lean in.</p>

      <p>She never treated Zostara as a student.</p>

      <p>She treated her as a mystery.</p>

      <p>Their lessons were strange, even by temple standards. Sometimes they didn’t speak at all. Meriel would simply hand her a bowl of moonwater and have her watch the ripples in silence. Other times, she would ask Zostara to speak her dreams aloud—then braid them into psalms or prayers, never saying why.</p>

      <p>One afternoon, during a quiet ritual at dusk, Meriel placed a single hand on Zostara’s brow and whispered:</p>

      <p><em>“You are not born of the Dawn.<br>
      You are the question it left behind.”</em></p>

      <p>Zostara never forgot that.</p>

      <p>Even as she grew older and left the Isles, even as her powers bloomed and her voice grew stronger, she carried Sister Meriel’s riddles like sacred seeds. And in her hardest moments—in nightmares and in glory—she sometimes hears that voice again, calm and certain as ever.</p>

      <p><em>“The light will not explain itself, child.<br>
      But it will arrive.<br>
      Be ready.”</em></p>

      <p>Meriel, for her part, still speaks of Zostara with curiosity. Not possession. Not pride.</p>

      <p>Curiosity.</p>

      <p>As if Zostara is not just a gifted student, but a living thread in a tapestry yet unwoven. A sign. A signifier.</p>

      <p>Not proof of prophecy.</p>

      <p>But the suggestion that perhaps Lysera has begun writing new ones.</p>

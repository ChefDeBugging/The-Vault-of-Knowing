    <br>
    <section class="npc-story">
      <p>Revna Hollowthorn was born beneath the bleeding skies of the Shadow Fell, mid-war and mid-scream. The Wail of the Void had already swallowed the sun, and the war that followed made monsters of many and martyrs of more. But Revna was neither. She was a survivor.</p>

      <p>Her childhood was an endless dusk of running and hiding, ash-choked winds and shattered stone. She learned to move in silence. To fight when needed. To kill when cornered. There was no childhood in the traditional sense—only instinct, grit, and cunning. When the war finally dulled to a simmer, Revna was already more blade than girl.</p>

      <p>It was during one of the darker winters that she found the sword—or perhaps, it found her. Deep within a ruined temple beneath the Isles, hidden behind veils of void-touched roots, she heard it whisper. A cursed relic. A demon forged into steel. It promised her power, vengeance, blood.</p>

      <p>She gave it laughter instead.</p>

      <p>They struck a pact—one built not on submission, but subversion. She would be its wielder, but not its servant. She would wield it for coin, for survival, for her own designs. But she would never let it rule her. And though the sword thirsted for ruin, Revna offered it only foes worth destroying. With every contract fulfilled, she bent its dark will further toward her own cause. With every drop of spilled blood, she gave it purpose beyond chaos.</p>

      <p>The blade raged.</p>

      <p>But it obeyed.</p>

      <p>She cannot leave the Twilight Isles—a condition bound into the pact. Whether this was the blade’s clause or hers is something she never clarifies. She doesn’t complain about it. The Isles are wide enough for war. And war is what she understands best.</p>

      <p>Now, she walks as a warlock-for-hire—cloak dark, humor darker. Her eyes hold a lightless gleam, the kind only born under a sunless sky. She doesn’t work for free. Doesn’t kill for sport. Doesn’t talk more than she needs to. But when Revna Hollowthorn draws her sword, there is silence—not from fear, but respect. And maybe a little fear, too.</p>

      <p>The people of the Isles call her the Blade That Burns Back—a torch in the dark that sets the shadows on fire. Not to banish them.</p>

      <p>But to remind them who they belong to.</p>

    <h2 class="npc-title">Of Hags, Hollowthorns, and Who Can Punch Harder</h2>
    <br>
    <section class="npc-story">
      <p>Meebs didn’t go looking for a warlock. She was just there to smash a hag.</p>

      <p>The bog near Briarhook had gone rotten—thick with choking vines, blighted lilies, and whispers that turned sane folk mad. Locals swore an ancient hag had taken root there, feeding on fear and fog. The town couldn’t afford a guild, so they posted coin for sellswords.</p>

      <p>Two showed up.</p>

      <p>One was Meebs, mud-streaked and eager, fist already wrapped like she was halfway into the fight.</p>

      <p>The other was Revna Hollowthorn.</p>

      <p>She arrived in silence—no cart, no pack, just a long dark coat and a sword that pulsed like it remembered screaming. The townsfolk avoided her eyes. Meebs didn’t.</p>

      <p>The two couldn’t have been more different—Meebs, wild and open like a crack of thunder; Revna, still as dusk. But monsters make strange friends, and hags don’t care for backstories. By the time they reached the bog’s heart, they were already sizing each other up—not as rivals, but as reflections.</p>

      <p>They fought like fire and shadow. Meebs burst through the hag’s root-cage with a roar, while Revna vanished into mist and reappeared behind her, blade sinking deep. It became a game mid-battle: who could land the cooler finishing move. Meebs suplexed a minion into the swamp. Revna impaled another with a tendril of void-light and whispered, “One.”</p>

      <p>By the time the hag fell, drowned in moonfire and muscle, they were laughing.</p>

      <p>When it was done, Revna simply said, “You're strong.”</p>

      <p>Meebs grinned. “So are you. Wanna punch trees ‘til one of us breaks a wrist?”</p>

      <p>Revna didn’t smile. But she stayed.</p>

      <p>For three days, they played games of strength—throwing stones farther than the treetops, punching through bark, arm wrestling in ankle-deep mud. There was no audience. No prize. Just two warriors, born for war but choosing joy for a little while.</p>

      <p>Then Revna vanished.</p>

      <p>No goodbyes. No reason. Just gone.</p>

      <p>But every few moons, when the jobs are slow or the wind feels right, she shows up again—same coat, same sword, same sharp quiet—and Meebs greets her like no time passed at all.</p>

      <p>They don’t talk much.</p>

      <p>They don’t need to.</p>

      <p>Because some bonds are forged not in words, but in battle cries, broken branches, and the unspoken thrill of knowing someone else hits just as hard as you do.</p>

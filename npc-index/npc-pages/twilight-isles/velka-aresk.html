    <section class="story-section">
      <p>Velka Aresk was born as the light dimmed.</p>

      <p>She took her first breath on the very cusp of the Shadow Fell, when the skies above the Twilight Isles began to bleed dusk and the first screams of war echoed across the waters. Too young to fight. Too old to forget. She survived what so many did not—watched the war swallow her village, her family, her friends, one by one, until memory became her only inheritance.</p>

      <p>She did not scream. She did not flee.</p>

      <p>She endured.</p>

      <p>When the ashes settled, Velka walked the ruined coastlines in silence. For days. For weeks. Some thought she was mad. Others thought her mute. But she was simply listening—to echoes, to grief, to the sharp, hollow shape of absence. She found no comfort in the prayers of priests or the vengeance of soldiers.</p>

      <p>She found ink. And skin.</p>

      <p>The first names she tattooed were her family’s—mother, father, two sisters, and a brother. She etched them onto her arms in black thread-fine script, each character shaped to mimic their handwriting. But the ink wasn’t just for mourning.</p>

      <p>It was for remembering.</p>

      <p>Velka had discovered something rare—perhaps divine, perhaps cursed. Her tattoos held more than names. When touched, they stirred with memory. Like the memory stones of the Kalashtar, they allowed a glimpse—just a moment—of the person lost. A laugh, a voice, a shared embrace. Not illusion. Not fantasy.</p>

      <p>True memory.</p>

      <p>And so, others came.</p>

      <p>The war had left thousands adrift in grief. Velka, still a girl herself, began to ink their losses into her own skin. When she ran out of room, she moved to parchment, and then to others. She opened her shop in a ruined temple, lit by candles and silence, where people would come to give her names, stories, sorrows—and she would give them remembrance in return.</p>

      <p>But the process has a cost.</p>

      <p>Velka does not merely write names. She sees them. Feels them. Every needle stroke draws the memory into her, and every grief becomes hers for a heartbeat. She has felt a mother’s final breath. A lover’s scream. A child’s laughter just before silence. It has made her wise. It has made her haunted.</p>

      <p>She does not smile often.</p>

      <p>But she never forgets a name.</p>

      <p>Now known as the Grave-Scribe, Velka is treated with reverence and unease. Her presence is like shadowed starlight—beautiful, distant, and not quite safe. She wears long robes that reveal just enough of her inked arms to let you wonder how many names lie beneath. Her voice is soft and careful, like every word might disturb something sacred.</p>

      <p>She speaks to the dead more than the living.</p>

      <p>And sometimes, if you’re quiet, you can hear them answer.</p>

      <p>Those who visit her remember more than their loved ones. They remember the weight of their own hearts, the shape of their pain, and the strange, cold comfort of being seen by someone who knows exactly what it is to carry ghosts.</p>

      <p>Velka Aresk does not believe in forgetting.</p>

      <p>She believes in bearing.</p>

      <p>And in ink, memory endures.</p>

    <section class="story-section">
      <p>Meebs didn’t know where she was when she stumbled into the ruin.</p>

      <p>The Twilight Isles were unlike anywhere she’d ever seen—strange, glowing plants humming in the dark, sky full of stars that felt far too close. She had no memory of arriving, only the ache of loss trailing behind her like a cloak too heavy to carry. Cold. Hungry. Haunted.</p>

      <p>She found shelter in what looked like an old, half-collapsed temple, tucked away beneath a cliff's edge and overgrown with moonvine and silence. She meant to sleep in the corner. Just one night. Just a little safety.</p>

      <p>Instead, she found warmth.</p>

      <p>And Velka Aresk.</p>

      <p>The woman barely looked up from her work—hands already stained in ink, the soft scratch of needle against skin filling the air like distant rain. But she saw Meebs. Truly saw her. Not just a dirty, half-wild girl with haunted eyes, but someone who had the same weight in her chest that Velka had carried her whole life.</p>

      <p>“Sit,” she said. “You don’t have to explain.”</p>

      <p>Meebs did anyway.</p>

      <p>They spoke for hours. Maybe days. The timeline blurred. Of war. Of death. Of family that wasn’t buried properly, or at all. Of names too sacred to say aloud, and ones shouted in rage before the last goodbye. Meebs, with her explosive heart and storm-rough voice, surprised even herself with how quiet she became.</p>

      <p>Velka didn’t offer healing.</p>

      <p>She offered recognition.</p>

      <p>A warm hearth. A meal. A bed that didn’t creak with nightmares. And the stillness of someone who knew that grief didn’t always need fixing. Sometimes, it just needed company.</p>

      <p>When Meebs finally left—guided by Velka’s directions scratched on the back of a spare parchment map—she carried more than orientation.</p>

      <p>She carried memory.</p>

      <p>Not a tattoo. Not a mark. But something deeper: the understanding that even in a place where the sun never rose, someone could still be a lantern.</p>

      <p>They’ve crossed paths since.</p>

      <p>Rarely. Briefly.</p>

      <p>But always with a nod. A glance. A shared silence that says: I remember.</p>

      <p>Because grief, in the hands of those who know how to hold it, can become something like friendship.</p>

      <p>And in the twilight between sorrow and survival, Meebs found both a guide and a kindred soul in the Grave-Scribe of the Isles.</p>

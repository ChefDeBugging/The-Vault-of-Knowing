    <h1 class="section-title">Captain Yorra Vayne – Queen of the Crimson Skies</h1>
    <br>
    <section class="story-section">
      <p>Yorra Vayne was born with silk sheets and coral crowns.</p>

      <p>Her family ruled one of the lesser isles of the Empire of Tides—a lush crescent of land famed for its orchards, pearls, and people too polite to be honest. From birth, Yorra was draped in finery and shackled with expectations. Debutante balls, diplomacy lessons, arranged future suitors—it was all so terribly dull.</p>

      <p>By the age of fourteen, she was sneaking out at night to fly her personal skimmer, a sleek, single-rider skyboard modified with stabilizers and a glass canopy. Her parents called it reckless.</p>

      <p>She called it liberation.</p>

      <p>She learned every current above her island. Every trick of wind and pressure. Every cloud that could hide a ship and every sunbeam that could blind a pursuer. Her instructors taught her poise.</p>

      <p>The sky taught her speed.</p>

      <p>By eighteen, she was gone. Not stolen. Not kidnapped.</p>

      <p>She left a note: "I love you all, but your life bores me to death. I’d rather die dancing on stormwinds than sipping tea with old men."</p>

      <p>And with that, she vanished—trading pearls for power.</p>

      <p>Yorra used her family’s parting gift—an obscenely generous inheritance—to purchase one of the finest mid-class skyships on the black market. She named it <strong>The Swank Plank</strong>, hired a crew of half-renegades, half-romantics, and made for the stormwalls.</p>

      <p>Within months, she was a pirate.</p>

      <p>Not the bloody kind, though she could fight like hell when needed. No, Yorra Vayne was a performer. She struck with flair, style, and excessive use of fireworks. Her attacks were choreographed, her escapes legendary. Her ship became a ghost tale among merchant fleets. The woman with red silk banners and a smile too wide for decency.</p>

      <p>She stole from the cruel, danced with the daring, and built a reputation not just as a threat—but as a spectacle.</p>

      <p>Eventually, the noble houses stopped searching for her.</p>

      <p>Some out of shame.</p>

      <p>Some out of respect.</p>

      <p>Now, she sails the skies with wind in her hair and a wineglass in hand, a storm at her back and mischief in her wake. She’s flamboyant, fearless, and just noble enough to make her enemies question whether they’re supposed to bow or run.</p>

      <p>Captain Yorra Vayne does not answer to bloodlines.</p>

      <p>She answers to the wind.</p>

      <p>And the wind is rarely polite.</p>

    <br>
    <section class="story-section">
      <p>Zostara’s first steps into the material world landed her in heat.</p>

      <p>Not trouble—yet—but true, shimmering heat. The kind that turned the sandstone streets of the Ember Desert port city into mirrored rivers. She arrived barefoot, dust on her cloak, the salt of sea air and spice on her breath. The people moved fast. The colors were loud. The music was louder.</p>

      <p>But Zostara didn’t flinch.</p>

      <p>She walked through it all like a melody looking for its chorus—watching, listening, tasting everything the world had to offer.</p>

      <p>And then, someone spilled wine on her.</p>

      <p>It was an accident. Probably.</p>

      <p>A flash of gold rings, violet silks, and a captain’s coat three sizes too dramatic for the weather swept past her, laughing as though she hadn’t just drenched a stranger. She turned only when Zostara called out.</p>

      <p>“Excuse me,” Zostara said, holding up her ruined shawl.</p>

      <p>The woman grinned with the kind of charm that should have come with a warning label. “Darling, if you're not spilling drinks in this city, you're doing it wrong.”</p>

      <p>That was how Zostara met Captain Yorra Vayne.</p>

      <p>They spent the rest of the day in a tavern with a broken door and a rooftop view, swapping stories like cards. Zostara didn’t give her full history—who would believe it?—but she didn’t need to. Yorra didn’t press. She was too busy ordering fruity liquors in colors that probably shouldn’t exist and arguing with the bartender about whether or not they served “ambiance.”</p>

      <p>Zostara, for her part, was entranced.</p>

      <p>Yorra was everything the Twilight Isles were not—loud, brash, brilliantly chaotic. She wasn’t bound by ritual or reverence. She followed wind and whim. And for a girl raised under whispers and riddles, it was intoxicating.</p>

      <p>They became friends.</p>

      <p>Briefly. Brightly.</p>

      <p>Yorra offered her a lift north when Zostara mentioned the Celestial Highlands, and Zostara—always hungry for the horizon—accepted. The flight was, in a word, perilous. Yorra piloted <strong>The Swank Plank</strong> with one hand on the wheel, one on a cocktail, and no hands on any semblance of a flight plan. But the stars above were magnificent, and the stories Yorra told more so.</p>

      <p>By the time they reached the Highlands, they were no longer strangers.</p>

      <p>They were a shared secret.</p>

      <p>Their paths parted there. Zostara stepped into her next chapter, and Yorra chased a rumor of treasure and scandal to the west.</p>

      <p>But time passed. Adventures unfolded. And when Zostara found herself needing a way out of the Highlands—fast, untraceable, and preferably stylish—she remembered a certain captain who had once spilled wine on her and apologized by ordering two more.</p>

      <p>So she called in a favor.</p>

      <p><strong>The Swank Plank</strong> arrived three days later, somehow louder than the storm it rode in on. And that was how Shade met Yorra Vayne.</p>

      <p>Not in a tavern. Not over drinks.</p>

      <p>But standing on a cliff’s edge, watching a skyship descend like a peacock with delusions of grandeur.</p>

      <p>Shade wasn’t impressed.</p>

      <p>Yorra was.</p>

      <p>The two didn’t like each other at first. But mutual usefulness breeds familiarity—and familiarity, if paired with just enough danger and just enough coin, breeds alliance.</p>

      <p>Now, when they cross paths, there’s no need for introductions. Just a smirk, a nod, and the shared understanding that whatever’s about to happen next probably isn’t legal.</p>

      <p>Or safe.</p>

      <p>But it’ll definitely be fun.</p>

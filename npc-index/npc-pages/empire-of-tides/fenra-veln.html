    <br>
    <section class="npc-story">
      <p>Fenra Veln was born in the middle of a war she didn’t choose.</p>

      <p>Not a grand war. Not one that would be etched in history or recited by scholars with maps and markers. Just a small, ugly, too-personal kind of war—a territorial dispute between pirate lords and the coastal noble who claimed the island she called home.</p>

      <p>The battles were loud. But the aftermath was louder.</p>

      <p>She remembered the smoke before she remembered birthdays. The way it clung to skin and cloth. The way it smeared the sky. Her earliest memories were of broken homes, crying neighbors, and the silence of people who had run out of tears.</p>

      <p>One day, the war came into her living room.</p>

      <p>She was eight. Small, scrappy, and halfway through a bowl of stew when the front door exploded off its hinges. A pirate burst through with eyes like cracked coal and a cutlass already red. Her brother was closest. Barely five years old. Frozen.</p>

      <p>Fenra didn’t think.</p>

      <p>She grabbed the ceremonial shield from above the hearth—an heirloom, never meant for use. The family crest was faded, its rim etched in dust. But it was heavy, and it was there.</p>

      <p>She threw herself between the blade and her brother and raised the shield.</p>

      <p>The steel rang like a bell when the sword struck.</p>

      <p>She didn’t drop it.</p>

      <p>The next moments were a blur—her father arriving, a shout, a scuffle, a groan. But the pirate didn’t win that day. And neither did fear.</p>

      <p>Fenra never let go of the shield again.</p>

      <p>She didn’t become a warrior. That path never tempted her. Too much blood. Too much grief. What she became was something rarer.</p>

      <p>A shield-maker.</p>

      <p>Not a blacksmith. Not a forger of death.</p>

      <p>A builder of safety.</p>

      <p>From the age of ten, she apprenticed under anyone who’d teach her. Metalsmiths, enchanters, woodworkers, alchemists—anyone who knew how to bind strength into shape. She studied old world techniques and forbidden crafts. She sketched designs in the margins of sleep and dreamed of impact resistance.</p>

      <p>And she never once made a weapon.</p>

      <p>Only shields.</p>

      <p>Round ones. Tower shields. Elven bucklers. Spellguard armplates. Riot discs etched with reflective wards. Shields that bent light. Shields that turned fire. Shields that sang with protective magic so old it forgot its own name.</p>

      <p>Each one was unique. Each one was a vow.</p>

      <p>People came from across the sea to find her. Nobles. Mercenaries. Paladins. Parents. Even pirates. She served them all—on one condition.</p>

      <p>Her shields were not to be used for conquest.</p>

      <p>Only defense.</p>

      <p>She did not craft for cowards or tyrants. Her clients needed to prove why they needed protection—and what they were willing to protect in return.</p>

      <p>Those who passed earned the finest defensive gear in the known world. Those who didn’t were politely shown the door. Sometimes not so politely.</p>

      <p>Fenra Veln became a legend not because she crafted for kings, but because she refused to craft for war.</p>

      <p>Her forge is built on a windswept cliff, far from any city. It overlooks the same ocean that once sent fire into her childhood—but now, it sends breeze and calm.</p>

      <p>She wakes each morning with soot in her hair and calluses on her fingers, and smiles with the quiet certainty of someone who knows their purpose.</p>

      <p>Some build thrones.</p>

      <p>Some build weapons.</p>

      <p>Fenra Veln builds shields.</p>

      <p>And in a world that always forgets who needs saving most, she remembers.</p>

      <p><em>Always.</em></p>

    <h2 class="npc-title">Of Sand, Steel, and a Promise Forged</h2>
    <br>
    <section class="npc-story">
      <p>The Ember Desert did not care who you were.</p>

      <p>It did not flinch at nobility, genius, or legend. It did not yield to gold, or fame, or even magic. It simply was—an ocean of heat and silence and wind-cut rock that stripped all pretense from a traveler until only truth remained.</p>

      <p>Fenra Veln learned this the hard way.</p>

      <p>She had come to the desert not for glory, but for honor. A famed paladin—known only as the Bastion of Sorrow—had ordered a custom shield for the protection of an ancient desert temple, and Fenra, as always, insisted on delivering it herself. She didn’t trust couriers with her work. Each piece she forged was a piece of her self, and she would not see it bent, broken, or misused by careless hands.</p>

      <p>But she had underestimated the sands.</p>

      <p>Her journey led her deep into the barren vastness—beyond the trade roads, past the sun-cracked ruins, and into the wilder reaches where even camels hesitated. The heat bled her strength. The wind stole her bearings. She rationed poorly. Walked longer than she should have. And when she finally collapsed among a field of broken crystal trees near the edge of the forest, she had nothing left but a half-empty flask and a fire sparked from fraying nerves.</p>

      <p>That’s where they found her.</p>

      <p>Vash saw the flicker of flame through his spyglass—a tiny heartbeat of light against the sea of dark stone and pale blue crystal. He called to Dent, and the two set out cautiously. Travelers at night were rare in the Ember. And those with fire were either fools… or desperate.</p>

      <p>They approached quietly. Measured. Expecting a trap.</p>

      <p>Instead, they found a woman with sunburnt shoulders, cracked lips, and soot-dusted fingers curled around the handle of a beautifully crafted shield.</p>

      <p>Fenra didn’t speak much at first. She never did with strangers. But Vash offered her water without question. Dent handed her food—dried meat, still warm. She nodded once in thanks and ate like a soldier between battles.</p>

      <p>The silence stretched, companionable and dry.</p>

      <p>Then Dent noticed the shield.</p>

      <p>He didn’t reach for it—just stared. With something almost reverent.</p>

      <p>“You make this?” he asked, his voice more metal than man.</p>

      <p>Fenra nodded. “All mine.”</p>

      <p>Vash leaned in, inspecting the intricate crestwork and the almost imperceptible humming of embedded enchantment. “You’re a shieldmaker,” he said, more observation than question. “Not many like you left.”</p>

      <p>“World’s got enough things built to kill,” she replied. “Figured someone should build what lets us live.”</p>

      <p>That night, they shared the fire.</p>

      <p>They traded few stories, but much understanding. Dent, curious and gentle in a way that surprised her. Vash, sharp but kind, with the sort of eyes that read a person before they spoke. They didn’t ask what she was doing in the desert. She didn’t ask what they were doing out here, either.</p>

      <p>But before dawn, as she packed her gear and shouldered the shield again, she turned to them.</p>

      <p>“If either of you ever make it to the Empire of Tides,” she said, her voice low but sure, “come to my forge on the cliffs of Armar’s Rise. Tell me your names.”</p>

      <p>She looked at Dent.</p>

      <p>“And I’ll make you a shield you can call part of yourself. Built into the arm. Clean, fast, perfect fit. For what you gave me tonight.”</p>

      <p>Dent blinked. “We didn’t give much.”</p>

      <p>Fenra smiled. “You gave it freely. And that’s rare.”</p>

      <p>Then she left—back into the desert, her steps steadier, her burden lighter.</p>

      <p>And though it would be some time before Dent found himself standing beneath the salty winds of Armar’s Rise, that promise never left him.</p>

      <p><em>Not once.</em></p>

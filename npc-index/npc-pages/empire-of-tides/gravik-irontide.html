    <br>
    <section class="npc-story">
      <p>Gravik Irontide was born not in a cradle, but in a chamber of brass and pressure.</p>

      <p>The submersible that served as his birthplace drifted through the black currents of the Deep Vein Trench, a region of the sea so dense with mineral sediment and magical flow that the hull hummed with power. His parents, seasoned adventurers and engineers of the Irontide clan, were mapping ancient leyline fractures when Gravik first cried—or rather, scowled. His mother said he emerged already grumbling.</p>

      <p>He was a sea dwarf by birthright, one of the deepfolk raised in the bubble-forged cities beneath the ocean floor. Home was a dome of crystal and coral, wrapped in spell-anchored steel, its lights powered by thermal currents and glowing anemone farms. Life below was tight-knit, industrious, and marvelously complex.</p>

      <p>Gravik loved it. The craft. The discipline. The roaring tales around luminous hearthstones. But most of all, he loved the sea.</p>

      <p>Not the undersea. The sea.</p>

      <p>The surface called to him. It started the first time he saw the sun fracture through the water in molten gold. And it only deepened when, on his twelfth nameday, he breached the surface aboard a cargo lifter and felt wind for the first time. Real wind. Not the current-press of ocean streams, but the open-mouthed howl of sky.</p>

      <p>He never forgot it.</p>

      <p>Gravik studied trade from the moment he could count rations. His family dealt in rare minerals and enchanted inks—used for rune-script and tideborn documents—and he learned fast. Quartermastery came as naturally as breathing salt.</p>

      <p>He could calculate load balance in his sleep. He memorized manifest codes by taste. (Literally. He claims that properly brewed ink should taste like brine and courage. He drinks it. No one asks why anymore.)</p>

      <p>When he came of age, he left the deep not out of spite, but out of yearning. His parents understood. They gave him a stormglass compass, their blessing, and a barrel of fermented squidmead so potent it could dissolve rust.</p>

      <p>Gravik roamed for a while. Worked with merchants. Smugglers. Even a coastal monastery with surprisingly good ale. But it wasn’t until he met Captain Maxwell Bloodmoon that things truly clicked.</p>

      <p>The Tabaxi was charming, cunning, and just chaotic enough to make Gravik feel useful. Maxwell didn’t need a yes-man. He needed someone to count barrels, question numbers, and bark orders when the rigging got tangled.</p>

      <p>Gravik thrived.</p>

      <p>He became the Sworn Quartermaster of the Crimson Gale, and quickly earned the crew’s trust with a sharp tongue, a sharper ledger, and the ability to down an entire mug of squidmead without flinching.</p>

      <p>He’s gruff. Precise. No-nonsense unless the nonsense involves rum, dice, or naval trivia. But beneath that stone-browed scowl is a dwarf who still watches the horizon like it owes him an answer.</p>

      <p>Gravik Irontide doesn’t speak much about his past.</p>

      <p>But if you catch him on a quiet night—ink-stained lips, eyes squinting at the stars—he might mutter a tale about the cities beneath the sea. About the ones who stayed. About how the tides always pull, but the sky…</p>

      <p><em>The sky lets you chase back.</em></p>

    <section class="npc-story">
      <p>Shade met Gravik Irontide the same way most people did—by accidentally sitting in his chair at a tavern table clearly marked by three empty mugs and a dagger halfway through the wood.</p>

      <p>To her credit, she didn’t flinch when the dwarf returned.</p>

      <p>“Don’t suppose you drink ink, do you?” he grumbled, motioning to the mug she had lifted.</p>

      <p>Shade took a sip. “Not usually. But this one’s got a bite.”</p>

      <p>Gravik grunted, half-annoyed, half-impressed. “That’s squidbone black. Mixed it meself. Tastes like shipwreck and shame.”</p>

      <p>Shade smirked. “Sounds like your cologne.”</p>

      <p>They were friends after that.</p>

      <p>Not fast friends. Not open or sentimental ones. But allies in sarcasm and shared patience for Captain Maxwell’s theatrical nonsense. Shade spent time with Maxwell often—helping with smuggling runs, exchanging rare goods, or simply hiding from enemies who wanted her less alive than she preferred. And wherever Maxwell was, Gravik wasn’t far behind.</p>

      <p>Gravik didn’t trust her at first. Not completely. She moved too quietly, smiled too easily, and kept too many blades hidden in too many sleeves.</p>

      <p>But over time, she proved herself.</p>

      <p>Not just with skill, but with respect—she didn’t cheat at cards (not obviously), and she paid her debts. When they gambled, it was with banter as much as coin. When they traded, it was always even. Shade never tried to out-haggle him. That alone earned his grudging approval.</p>

      <p>Eventually, she invited him to visit her guildhold.</p>

      <p>He scoffed, said he’d rather drink saltwater. But curiosity won. And when he saw the mess she called an inventory system, he went silent for a long, grim minute.</p>

      <p>Then rolled up his sleeves and got to work.</p>

      <p>He didn’t just help—he overhauled. Designed a new ledger method using coded symbols and rotating tallies. Reinforced her storage chests with hidden compartments and anti-tamper wards. Taught her quartermasters how to track spoils with a level of precision that would make a tax collector weep with joy.</p>

      <p>Shade paid him in old wine, rare maps, and a crossbow he’d been eyeing for months. But what sealed it wasn’t the payment—it was the final night he stayed.</p>

      <p>They sat on the roof of the guildhouse, sharing a bottle of something illegal and sweet. Shade asked why he helped.</p>

      <p>Gravik shrugged. “Because you’re Maxwell’s pain in the ass. And somehow, that makes you mine too.”</p>

      <p>They clinked glasses, said nothing else.</p>

      <p>And from then on, whenever The Velvet Mask or the Crimson Gale needed something arranged—coin, cargo, or quiet—you could count on Gravik Irontide… as long as you kept the ink flowing and the nonsense to a minimum.</p>

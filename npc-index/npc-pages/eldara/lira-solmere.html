    <h1 class="npc-title">Lira Solmere – The Gleam Between Roots</h1>
    <br>
    <section class="npc-story">
      <p>Some elves are born beneath silver starlight or amidst choirs of arcane song.</p>

      <p>Lira Solmere was born barefoot, half-covered in dirt, and laughing as she tumbled down a mossy hill into a puddle of glowing mushroom water.</p>

      <p>Silvershade Haven raised her like one of its own—a child of the Ironwood, yes, but also of the dwarves who lived beneath its boughs. She played with stone-skinned boys who taught her how to take a punch and gave as good as she got. She ran through brambles with reckless joy, whispering secrets to the trees and daring the owlbears to chase her. Even the lurking dangers of the forest didn’t scare her. They were part of the dance.</p>

      <p>But the sea… the sea was a different song.</p>

      <p>As she aged, her curiosity turned outward. She took to the water like a selkie, sailing with her childhood friends beyond the Ironwood coast toward the Shattered Reefs. What they found there changed everything.</p>

      <p>Crystals—towering, singing, humming with hidden magic—rose from the depths like the spines of some dreaming titan. Their light flickered not with sun, but with memory. And Lira, bold as ever, touched one… and heard it hum her name.</p>

      <p>She was hooked.</p>

      <p>The study began in earnest. She camped on the reefs, sketched by starlight, and shattered specimens under moonbeams to test their cores. The dwarves helped her craft tools—chisels of enchanted ironwood, lenses made from polished shardglass. Together, they mapped the reef, cataloged its quirks, and built their first weapons infused with crystalline resonance.</p>

      <p>But it wasn’t enough.</p>

      <p>She needed more. Different crystals. Different forests. Different dangers.</p>

      <p>The Crystal Forests of the Ember Desert called to her.</p>

      <p>She and her crew journeyed inland, through sandstorms and scorpion pits, past wyvern roosts and into the glittering madness of that radiant wild. They fought. They bled. But they learned. And each new mineral, each arcane dust, brought new alchemy to her growing trove of knowledge.</p>

      <p>When the dust settled, they built something permanent.</p>

      <p>In the coastal city of Driftwake, nestled between desert heat and ocean salt, Lira opened her shop: a place where weapons glowed faintly with elemental energy, where powders shimmered like stardust, and where no two concoctions ever behaved quite the same. She’d speak in riddles to her customers, selling them what they didn’t know they needed. A dagger that sings in the hands of the betrayed. A tonic that only works if taken while upside down. A vial that explodes when spoken to kindly.</p>

      <p>She called it “resonance.”</p>

      <p>Others called it madness.</p>

      <p>Then the Ashen Covenant came.</p>

      <p>They weren’t after her goods—they wanted her mind. Her studies. Her insight into crystals as magical conduits, into the blend of nature and arcana that pulsed at the edge of known science. They invited her to Eldara. Offered her the Vault of Knowing.</p>

      <p>She said yes. Of course she did.</p>

      <p>But she left the shop to her dwarven kin. Left instructions, riddles, formulas etched in luminous chalk. And they carry on her legacy in Driftwake, their hammers echoing with her laughter and their brews just unstable enough to still feel like her.</p>

      <p>Lira Solmere doesn’t fear the unknown.<br>
      She sails toward it.<br>
      Dust on her hands.<br>
      Light in her bones.<br>
      And the promise of discovery always gleaming just beyond the next wave.</p>

    <h2 class="npc-title">Of Sparks and Shattered Powder</h2>
    <br>
    <section class="npc-story">
      <p>Driftwake was not what it once was.</p>

      <p>The salt still hung heavy in the air, the markets still bustled with trade, and the docks still groaned under the weight of caravans and cargo. But something new buzzed in the breeze—an edge of magic, metallic and humming like a chord waiting to snap.</p>

      <p>Vash felt it the moment his boots hit the cobblestones.</p>

      <p>He’d been here dozens of times. For parts. For powder. For peace, sometimes. But this trip was different. He had a list of supplies, a tight purse, and a cracked firing pin he hadn’t had time to fix. He expected the usual merchants—the same crates of damp shot, the same overpriced flint.</p>

      <p>He did not expect the dwarves shouting over one another about “crystal resonance vectors” and “shardburst formations.”</p>

      <p>Or the storefront glowing like starlight filtered through glacier glass.</p>

      <p>The sign read: <em>Solmere’s Resonant Forge.</em></p>

      <p>Inside, the air was alive.</p>

      <p>Weapons rested in floating displays, suspended in slow rotation by rings of glowing crystal. Bomb vials shimmered with shifting color. A glaive whispered softly to itself in a language he couldn’t understand. And behind the counter, a young dwarf leaned against a workbench made of what looked like polished reefstone, fiddling with a musket that reloaded backward.</p>

      <p>Vash was already reaching for his coin pouch.</p>

      <p>It wasn’t long before the dwarves noticed his own guns—crafted with care, but outclassed by what they had on offer. They didn’t mock him. They <em>grinned</em>, proud and wide, and showed him a piece that made his breath catch: not ironwood—gods no, that was for noble wallets—but smooth, crystal-inlaid alloy that pulsed faintly in time with his heartbeat. The action was flawless. The balance, perfect. It was a shooter’s dream.</p>

      <p>He bought it on the spot. And then, with what coin he had left, he bought powders.</p>

      <p>Not your average shot. These were crystalline blends, crushed and infused with minor spells. One made bullets <em>curve</em> around corners. Another turned a small pistol into a one-shot blunderbuss. One vial had a warning etched into the glass: <em>Do not apologize while holding this.</em></p>

      <p>Vash tested one that night in a safe clearing outside town.</p>

      <p>The resulting crater was about the size of a tavern.</p>

      <p>When he returned the next day, half to say thanks and half to ask if they’d meant for that to happen, he met her.</p>

      <p><strong>Lira Solmere.</strong></p>

      <p>She looked like the shop—chaotic, brilliant, unpredictable. Her eyes glinted like fractured amethyst, and her words were riddles wrapped in metaphors wrapped in outright nonsense. But the nonsense always came true.</p>

      <p>“You’ll come back,” she said, examining the scorch marks on his coat. “Not for powder. For purpose.”</p>

      <p>He didn’t know what that meant. Still doesn’t.</p>

      <p>But he’s been back many times since.</p>

      <p>He never gets the same gunpowder twice.</p>

      <p>And every time he asks how something works, the dwarves just shrug and say,<br>
      “Lira dreams ’em. We just make ’em real.”</p>

    <h1 class="npc-title">Brenn Talveth – The Eye Beyond the Page</h1>
    <br>
    <section class="npc-story">
      <p>Brenn Talveth was born where the desert meets the sea—Velmara, jewel of the Ember Desert’s eastern coast. Her family held sway over a large portion of Solace Bay, a place of silken waves, gentle breezes, and endless comfort. Theirs was a life of luxury, built not on conquest or cunning, but on the slow accumulation of influence, hospitality, and inherited gold. And yet, for all the indulgences available to her, Brenn found her heart beating not for the sun-warmed waters or the promise of parties—but for paper.</p>

      <p>Books became her world. Her family’s private library was larger than most homes in Velmara, with domed skylights and polished floors and rows of ancient tomes that whispered secrets in her dreams. She read everything. Theology, folklore, apocrypha, spell theory, riddles carved into the edges of forgotten scrolls. Her parents let her be. Why not? She was quiet. Polite. Brilliant. And never caused a moment’s trouble.</p>

      <p>But then came the visions.</p>

      <p>At first, she thought they were dreams—symbols and fragments of things yet to pass. But when a trader’s ship arrived just as she had described it, sails torn exactly so, crew shivering from a disease she’d read about only days earlier, she knew better. It wasn’t imagination. It was sight.</p>

      <p>The gift grew stronger. Wilder. She tried to control it. Channel it through her studies. She read faster. Deeper. Hungrier. Then, one evening, she opened a tome bound in sun-cracked red leather. The language within was ancient—so ancient it moved when she looked at it. And it looked back. She screamed once. Then went silent. Her right eye dimmed and died, claimed by the curse bound into the ink itself.</p>

      <p>But she didn’t stop reading.</p>

      <p>Instead, she left.</p>

      <p>She had heard whispers of Eldara all her life. The city was spoken of with respect, if not reverence—especially by the Ashen Covenant, who often visited her family on discreet financial matters. So she waited. And when a missionary came to Velmara, Brenn approached without hesitation, and left the coast behind.</p>

      <p>In Eldara, she was examined. Studied. Revered. Her gift was not common, nor was it easily explained. The Vault of Knowing opened its deeper corners to her, recognizing in her a mind attuned not just to knowledge, but to the spaces between knowing. She reads with her hands now—her remaining eye often closed, trusting the current of foresight more than the clarity of words. She sorts texts others fear to touch. She converses with books no longer legible. She pieces together truths buried in conflicting myths and maps.</p>

      <p>Some say her cursed eye still sees—but not this world. That in her dreams, she walks the outer rings of time, gathering glimpses and fragments like flowers in a broken garden.</p>

      <p>She rarely speaks of her past. Her family believes she is dead or lost. She has not corrected them.</p>

      <p>Velmara was peace.</p>

      <p>But in Eldara, Brenn Talveth found purpose.</p>

      <p>And beneath the vaulted stones of the library halls, she reads not to pass the time—but to catch it. Before it passes us all.</p>

    <h2 class="npc-title">Of Salt, Sand, and a Scholar’s Laugh</h2>
    <br>
    <section class="npc-story">
      <p>It had been a rough few months. Long days, longer nights, too many secrets, and not enough sleep. Zostara needed a break. And Shade, though she would never admit it, needed one even more. So Zostara did what any stubborn best friend would do: she booked a trip, packed two bags, and dragged a reluctant rogue by the wrist all the way to Solace Bay.</p>

      <p>Shade hated wet sand in her fur. Hated the sun, the crowds, the cloying scent of overpriced fruit drinks. But she didn't hate the sea, and she didn’t hate Zostara. So she went. And after enough coaxing (and enough drinks), she even let herself relax—just a little—on a shaded chair beside the shoreline.</p>

      <p>That’s when the books arrived.</p>

      <p>Fifteen, maybe twenty, stacked so high they swayed with each step of the girl carrying them. She looked barely as old as they were. Half-elven, sharp-eyed, distracted in a way that only true intellectuals ever managed to be. She dropped the stack with a puff of sand, summoned a chair from thin air with a casual flick of the wrist, and collapsed into it like she’d conquered the entire desert.</p>

      <p>Zostara was immediately intrigued.</p>

      <p>“What are you reading?” she asked, turning on her side, propped up on an elbow.</p>

      <p>Brenn blinked. “No idea,” she said, not even looking up. “I just grabbed whatever caught my eye. I figured the beach deserved a little chaos.”</p>

      <p>Shade snorted into her drink.</p>

      <p>What followed was an hours-long conversation that stretched like the tide. Brenn didn’t just know things—she understood them. Deep, complex knowledge delivered with effortless clarity. She spoke of ancient artifacts as if she'd held them, of divine lore as if she'd read it in the margins of some cosmic ledger. She was odd in the best way—eccentric, blunt, quietly brilliant. They learned her name only after the second drink. Brenn Talveth.</p>

      <p>When she invited them to her home library, neither Shade nor Zostara hesitated.</p>

      <p>The library was more like a museum crossed with a treasure hoard. Floor-to-ceiling shelves crammed with texts—some glowing, some whispering, some vibrating faintly in their bindings. Books in languages neither of them had ever seen. Brenn handed them rare wines and rarer books, and the three talked long into the night—about time, power, fate, and foolish ideas best left to madmen and visionaries.</p>

      <p>They fell asleep in a tangle of blankets and parchment, surrounded by drifting candlelight and the scent of old pages.</p>

      <p>By morning, Brenn was already awake, scribbling notes into the margins of a floating tome. She thanked them for the company, offered them a breakfast they politely declined, and waved them off with a sleepy smile.</p>

      <p>They never saw her again.</p>

      <p>But even years later, whenever Zostara thinks of unexpected joy… or when Shade finds sand in a book spine and scowls with faint affection—they both remember that day.</p>

      <p>The sun. The surf.<br>
      And the girl who brought a fortress of knowledge to the beach.</p>

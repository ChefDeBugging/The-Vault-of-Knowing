    <br>
    <section class="story-section">
      <p>Ilreth Solshade was born in the golden bloom of the Dawn Cycle, when the Twilight Isles still basked in morning light and the sea caught fire with each rising sun. As a Kalashtar child, she carried the quiet strength of her people and the strange, patient pull of dreams that knew more than they should.</p>

      <p>She was raised among tide-blessed gardens and stone-lantern paths, where songs were whispered into salt winds and memories lived longer than names. But Ilreth’s mind drifted beyond the reverent calm of the Isles. She heard stories in shadows, truths in riddles. Even as a girl, she dreamed of things no one could explain.</p>

      <p>Temples swallowed by sand. Statues weeping ink. Gods with empty faces calling out from beneath the world.</p>

      <p>Her dreams were not warnings. They were invitations.</p>

      <p>She didn’t flee the Twilight Isles. She simply followed where the dreams led.</p>

      <p>Ilreth left before the Shadow Fell—before the Wail of the Void stole the Isles’ cycle of rebirth and plunged them into an eternal dusk. She was already long gone by then, walking broken roads through forgotten kingdoms, searching for myths too inconvenient for modern scholars to keep alive.</p>

      <p>The world did not mourn the loss of dawn.</p>

      <p>Outside the Isles, life continued. Skies still brightened. Crops still grew. The balance had shifted, yes—but subtly, like a song just slightly out of tune. Most didn’t notice.</p>

      <p>But Ilreth did.</p>

      <p>Her power had always thrummed with the light of the dawn, and though she would never again feel its full warmth, she refused to falter. Her journey became one of remembrance—gathering stories scattered by time, hunting for meaning in margins and myths, and piecing together a forgotten heritage written not in books, but in the bones of the earth.</p>

      <p>Years later, she arrived in the Celestial Highlands—quiet, composed, and wrapped in starlight silks that carried the scent of incense and sea.</p>

      <p>The Citadel offered her a place. They did not understand her, but they respected her history. A Kalashtar born in light, walked through darkness, and now returned with riddles wrapped in wisdom? They called her eccentric. Enigmatic. A curiosity worthy of tenure.</p>

      <p>She called it a lantern.</p>

      <p>Ilreth teaches now—not to preserve knowledge, but to awaken wonder. Her classroom glows with scented candles and open windows, her lessons a dance of metaphor and myth. She rarely answers questions, but always asks the right ones. Her students say her words echo long after the bell, usually when it rains, or when they dream of stars.</p>

      <p>She still dreams.</p>

      <p>Still follows the thread of some forgotten song, woven between constellations and carved into ruins. And some nights, when the skies are clear, she stands on the edge of the Citadel and listens—not for mourning, but for memory.</p>

      <p>Because the world may not remember the dawn.</p>

      <p>But Ilreth Solshade does.</p>

      <p>And in the remembering, she knows—</p>

      <p><em>It is not gone. Only waiting.</em></p>

    <h2 class="section-title">Of Lanterns, Legends, and the Girl Who Listened</h2>
    <br>
    <section class="story-section">
      <p>Zostara remembered few lessons from the Citadel that stayed with her—not because they weren’t well-taught, but because they weren’t meant to be remembered. Most were rehearsals of pride, long-form lullabies about elven supremacy and the "proper" flow of magic.</p>

      <p>But Ilreth Solshade taught differently.</p>

      <p>Her classroom had no light crystals. No enchanted slates. The windows were always open, letting in drifting pollen or moon-silver mist. She spoke in riddles. In fables. In near-forgotten tongues that tasted of starlight and salt.</p>

      <p>The first day Zostara found her, it was by accident.</p>

      <p>She had been following a whisper—some stray student’s rumor about “the mad mythkeeper with the smoke-lantern voice.” She expected an eccentric. Instead, she found a room that felt like stepping into a forgotten memory.</p>

      <p>No desks. Just cushions. No lectures. Just stories.</p>

      <p>And at the center: a woman swathed in pale robes that looked like wind caught in silk, her hair a waterfall of shimmering grey that refused to settle. She stood beside a single, flickering lantern—dim and steady—and whispered:</p>

      <p><em>“All truth begins as a tale too strange to believe.”</em></p>

      <p>That day, she spoke of cities swallowed by the sky, of lovers sealed in crystal and gods who wept so fiercely they drowned an entire continent in dreams.</p>

      <p>Zostara stayed after the bell.</p>

      <p>And Ilreth noticed.</p>

      <p>She always noticed.</p>

      <p>Most students drifted through her class for the novelty—curious to see the eccentric relic-hunter turned instructor. But few stayed longer than they had to. Fewer still listened. Ilreth never changed her pace, never softened her riddles. Her lessons required faith. Imagination. Patience.</p>

      <p>Zostara had all three.</p>

      <p>And Ilreth… Ilreth was delighted.</p>

      <p>It wasn’t just that someone was listening. It was who was listening.</p>

      <p>A young Kalashtar. Born outside the Dawn Cycle. A spark of the old light in a world dimming fast.</p>

      <p>The Kalashtar were not supposed to still happen—not truly. Not since the Shadow Fell and the shattering of the sun-cycle. Their birth was a divine accident, a rare echo of the light that once bathed the world. And here one was, sitting cross-legged on a moss-cushion, furiously scribbling down every word of her fragmented myths and tangled metaphors.</p>

      <p>It made Ilreth’s breath catch.</p>

      <p>She never said so aloud. But she began to leave harder texts open where Zostara would sit. She layered deeper meanings into the stories she told, watching the girl’s eyes dart and widen as she pieced them together. She smiled more when Zostara raised her hand. And once—only once—she gifted her a page from a journal Ilreth had kept during her travels, marked with a folded corner and an ink blot shaped like a crow.</p>

      <p><em>“Even birds with clipped wings,”</em> it read, <em>“learn to dream of the wind.”</em></p>

      <p>Zostara kept that page hidden in the lining of her satchel ever since.</p>

      <p>They weren’t close, not exactly. Not in the way Zostara was with Shade, or Selene. But there was something between them—an unspoken current, like the hush that falls just before a story begins.</p>

      <p>Ilreth never asked about her past. She never commented on the whispering dreams that sometimes made Zostara flinch in the halls. But when her lessons turned toward lost pantheons, or forgotten gods, she would glance at her quietly—just for a moment—and Zostara would know:</p>

      <p><em>She saw her.</em></p>

      <p>Not her name. Not her lineage. Her.</p>

      <p>In a Citadel built on appearances and inheritance, Ilreth taught Zostara that myth was more than memory. That magic was not a science, but a song. That truth did not need permission to be real.</p>

      <p>And Zostara—burning bright in secret, stitched together by shadow and fate—sat in that quiet, fable-lit room and listened.</p>

      <p>Years later, she still remembers that light. Still wonders if Ilreth's lantern is burning. If the stories she told might be more than just metaphors.</p>

      <p>And if somewhere in those strange old riddles, Ilreth had seen the end coming before anyone else dared name it.</p>

      <p>Because while the rest of the Citadel taught knowledge…</p>

      <p><strong>Ilreth Solshade taught remembrance.</strong></p>

      <p><em>And remembrance, Zostara would learn, is where all true magic begins.</em></p>

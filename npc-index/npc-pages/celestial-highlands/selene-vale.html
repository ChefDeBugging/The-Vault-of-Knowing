  <h1 style="text-align: center;">Selene Vale – The Enchanter of Unspoken Smiles</h1>
  <br>
  <section>
    <p>In the crystal spires of the Citadel, where silence was a virtue and grace a law, Selene Vale existed like a song no one could stop humming.</p>

    <p>A pure-blood high elf of a well-respected lineage, Selene was born beneath etched vaults and glowing sigils, surrounded by perfection and pressure. From the moment she could walk, she was expected to follow the unspoken choreography of noble life: bow just enough, speak just softly enough, never laugh too loud.</p>

    <p>And she didn’t.</p>

    <p>She giggled. She twirled her pen between her fingers during lectures. She snuck warm pastries into the library and once used an illusion spell to animate a robe into a dancing ghost for her roommate's birthday.</p>

    <p>She was strange. But she was theirs. And in the Citadel, that meant untouchable.</p>

    <p>No one ever questioned her. Not truly. Even when she beamed too brightly, or interrupted a ceremony to compliment a noble’s ring (“It’s got that perfect death-magic-meets-artisan vibe”), the most anyone said was: “That’s just Selene.”</p>

    <p>What they never suspected was what she really spent her time on.</p>

    <p>Selene was a genius, and she knew it. But while her peers chased prestige in public, she found her joy in the underground enchantments of the everyday. Trinkets. Totems. Laughing bangles. Whispering earrings. Quills that flirted with you. Pendants that glowed warmer when someone nearby was being dishonest.</p>

    <p>She didn’t want glory. She wanted to bring magic into the hands of the forgotten.</p>

    <p>And so she began to sell them—quietly. Hidden beneath illusion-marked satchels, wrapped in song-runes that disguised their true nature. Her buyers were classmates who wanted love charms, travelers who heard whispers on the Isles, and even a few adventurers looking for clever tricks.</p>

    <p>But the Citadel never noticed. They couldn’t.</p>

    <p>Because to them, Selene Vale—odd as she was—was one of them. A golden child. A Vale. Born within the sanctified walls. A little eccentric, maybe, but still brilliant, still flawless, still part of their marble order.</p>

    <p>They couldn’t imagine her as anything else.</p>

    <p>And so Selene thrived in the blind spot of a society that worshiped its own image. She gathered raw materials under the guise of study. She borrowed tools that were “clearly logged under special project access”. And she created beauty, usefulness, and laughter in secret.</p>

    <p>Not for rebellion. Not for revenge. For joy. For business. For the sheer thrill of slipping something messy and bright into a world that prided itself on being pale and perfect.</p>

    <p>One day, she dreams of opening her own shop—far from the Citadel’s walls, where customers don’t expect pedigree, just good magic and a better conversation.</p>

    <p>But for now, she smiles her strange little smile, blends in just enough, and keeps her work humming just below the surface of the tower that raised her.</p>

  <h2 style="text-align: center;">Of Trinkets, Trouble, and Trade Deals in Shadows</h2>
  <br>
  <section>
    <p>The Citadel of the Celestial Highlands was carved into mountains that had never known dust. Its towers gleamed with moonlight polished brighter than truth. Its halls echoed with centuries of perfect silence.</p>

    <p>And Selene Vale shattered that silence like a giggle in a library.</p>

    <p>Zostara met her while lost—both figuratively and literally. It was her second week in the Citadel, and she’d taken a wrong turn trying to find the Aetheric Theory hall. Instead, she found a girl upside down, balanced on a stone railing three stories up, trying to enchant a teacup into singing opera.</p>

    <p>The teacup exploded. Selene yelped. Zostara applauded.</p>

    <p>That was the beginning.</p>

    <p>They weren’t supposed to be friends. Zostara was already seen as “other,” a foreign-born prodigy with strange eyes and unorthodox magic. Selene was citadel-bred, pure-blooded, pedigreed, and profoundly... odd.</p>

    <p>While other elves practiced flawless illusions and recited ancient poetry, Selene built charms that mimicked hiccups or made your shadow dance independently during lectures. She once gifted Zostara a cloak that changed color to match your emotional dishonesty. It turned magenta every time Zostara lied about being fine.</p>

    <p>They shared stolen pastries behind spellwork towers. Sang duets through magical funnels during midnight storms. Once enchanted a statue of a founding archmage to wink lecherously at passing professors.</p>

    <p>By the time anyone noticed, no one could prove anything.</p>

    <p>Selene called her “Crunchy”, a nickname that made no sense and stuck like sap. When asked why, she’d once explained: “Well, Zost kinda sounds like toast… and toast is crunchy. Ergo, you’re Crunchy.”</p>

    <p>Zostara had stared at her for a long time. Then laughed. And never shook the name.</p>

    <p>Zostara called her “the walking enchantment accident.” Selene took it as praise.</p>

    <p>But not all their fun was harmless.</p>

    <p>Selene’s talents, though cloaked in whimsy, were genuinely brilliant. Her totems worked. Her charms sold. Quietly, she started passing them off to classmates. Then to Isle-bound apprentices. And then—through whispered favors—to places far outside the Highlands.</p>

    <p>Zostara noticed. She never reported her. Instead, one night while sipping glowing cider on the roof of the star-mapping observatory, she simply said:</p>

    <p>“You ever think about selling more?”</p>

    <p>Selene blinked. “Is that a test?”</p>

    <p>Zostara smiled sideways. “No. But it might be the start of a good mistake.”</p>

    <p>The next night, Selene followed Zostara to a forgotten staircase behind the east tower, where no light crystals ever bloomed. They descended in silence. The tunnels beyond the Citadel had no name, only dust and stone and history that refused to be archived.</p>

    <p>That’s where she met Shade.</p>

    <p>The figure was already waiting—leaning against a wall, almost a part of it, like the shadow of something sharp. Her face was half-covered, and the only thing more unnerving than her silence was her stillness. She didn’t acknowledge Selene at first.</p>

    <p>Selene cleared her throat. “You must be—”</p>

    <p>“No names,” Shade said.</p>

    <p>“Rude,” Selene muttered, then louder: “I brought pastries. Also magic. Mostly magic.”</p>

    <p>Zostara stepped between them, the bridge as always. “Selene’s the one I told you about.”</p>

    <p>Shade's eyes flicked to her. "The charm dealer?"</p>

    <p>Selene grinned. “Prefer the term ‘enchantment entrepreneur,’ but sure.”</p>

    <p>For a long beat, no one spoke.</p>

    <p>Then Shade simply turned, lifted part of the stone wall with a rune Zostara had never seen before, and gestured into a corridor lit with shimmering wards.</p>

    <p>“Follow me if you’re serious.”</p>

    <p>Selene’s eyes lit up like she’d been handed a spellbook titled Secrets and Shenanigans. She followed.</p>

    <p>From that night onward, a new rhythm took shape.</p>

    <p>Selene crafted—at first cautiously, then boldly. Shade handled the movement. Zostara kept the peace and patched over any flare-ups. The trio met beneath the Citadel when the stars were right and the instructors blind. Crates were packed with whispering rings, flirtatious quills, joke curses that made boots moo when you lied.</p>

    <p>They weren’t just ridiculous. Some were useful. Quiet stealth charms. Emergency blink tokens. Wards that hummed softly when danger neared.</p>

    <p>Selene finally saw her creations touch the world. Not the world the elves deemed worthy—but the world as it was. She got secret letters from mercenaries thanking her for a heartbeat tracker that saved their squad. One courier smuggled her a thank-you pastry enchanted to cry when bitten.</p>

    <p>She cried with it.</p>

    <p>Some nights, Zostara and Selene would still laugh together like schoolgirls. Other nights, all three would sit by quiet flame, silent and planning.</p>

    <p>One bright with madness. One veiled in mirth. One cloaked in night.</p>

    <p>But together—they moved more than just charms. They moved the edge of a sleeping empire.</p>

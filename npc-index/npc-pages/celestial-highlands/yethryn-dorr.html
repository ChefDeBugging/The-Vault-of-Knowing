  <h1 style="text-align: center;">Yethryn Dorr – The Sky’s Forgotten Compass</h1>
<br>
  <section>
    <p>Yethryn Dorr was born under a storm-thick canopy in the heart of the Ironwood, where the stars were whispered about more than seen. Even as a child, she listened more to the wind than her tutors, more to the rhythm of falling leaves than the rigid doctrines of her village. Her eyes always drifted upward—to the few patches of sky that broke through the ancient trees, to the slivers of moonlight that pierced the branches like forgotten promises.</p>

    <p>When she came of age, she did not linger.</p>

    <p>The Ironwood could hold her body, but never her gaze. She walked the world in slow circles, chasing clearer skies and stranger constellations, mapping the heavens as if they were a letter written only to her. Eventually, her journey brought her to the Celestial Highlands—where the sky stretched wider than belief and the stars sang louder than memory.</p>

    <p>There, she stayed.</p>

    <p>Perched atop one of the highest towers of the Citadel, Yethryn built her observatory not of stone, but of glass and enchanted brass. Her walls shimmered with floating ink, her floors etched with spinning charts of constellations that never held still. Students often found her half-asleep on the ceiling, scribing new starpaths upside-down while mumbling in languages that hadn’t been spoken since the last dawn.</p>

    <p>But before the tower and the Highlands, before the Citadel whispered about her like a half-forgotten poem, there was a ship. A captain. A deal.</p>

    <p><strong>Captain Maxwell Bloodmoon.</strong></p>

    <p>The two met in a dockside bar in the Empire of Tides, after Yethryn had been thrown out of a cartographer’s guild for “mapping lies and moon-madness.” Maxwell had laughed, asked her to prove it. She’d drawn him a star chart on the back of a tavern menu. Three weeks later, they found a lost pirate hoard exactly where the stars had told her it would be.</p>

    <p>That was the beginning of a long, strange partnership.</p>

    <p>He sailed. She mapped. He fought. She pointed. From shattered reefs to bleeding comets, they chased fortune and anomaly, building a bond on wind, trust, and a healthy dose of mischief. She never cared for gold, but she adored the chaos of the chase—and he never once questioned her maps, no matter how mad they seemed.</p>

    <p>Years passed. The world shifted. The tides turned.</p>

    <p>Maxwell returned to piracy. Yethryn returned to the stars.</p>

    <p>But they never truly lost contact.</p>

    <p>To this day, she sends him maps—rolled scrolls sealed with starlight ink. Some lead to hidden caches or strange weather phenomena. Others seem like nonsense: spirals within spirals, celestial riddles tied to long-dead gods or sky-sewn symbols only she understands.</p>

    <p>He never complains. She never explains.</p>

    <p>And now, most in the Citadel think she’s gone mad.</p>

    <p>She speaks to herself in stardream code. She charts constellations that don’t exist, names them after phrases no one else can pronounce. Some days she claims the stars are warning her. Other days she laughs and says they’re just lonely.</p>

    <p>But madness has never frightened her.</p>
    <p>What frightens her is silence.</p>

    <p>So Yethryn Dorr keeps watching. Keeps mapping. Keeps whispering to the sky. Because deep down, she knows something is changing—something vast and slow and shining behind the veil of stars. The same whisper that once pulled her from the Ironwood now claws at her mind in the shape of a prophecy no one believes.</p>

    <p>The stars are shifting. The patterns are breaking. And somewhere in that breaking, Yethryn has seen the outline of something immense.</p>

    <p>She just hasn’t found the words for it yet.</p>
    <p>But she’s close.</p>

    <p>So she writes. She dreams. She waits.</p>

    <p>And when the stars finally speak plainly again…<br>
    She’ll be the only one who knows how to listen.</p>

    <h2>Of Falling Stars and Shadowed Fates</h2>
    <br>
    <p>Shade didn’t seek out many people in the Highlands. Most of them talked too much, or not at all—wrapped in their own sanctimonious glow, like they were born breathing thinner, cleaner air.</p>

    <p>But Yethryn Dorr was different.</p>
    <p>Not easier. Not warmer. Just… stranger.</p>

    <p>The first time Shade found her, she hadn’t intended to. She was tailing a noble scholar rumored to be illegally trading celestial relics. The trail led her to the outermost spire of the Citadel, where the wind never stopped humming and stars bled into the sky long before nightfall.</p>

    <p>And there she was.</p>

    <p>Yethryn. Dangling from a platform by one hand, sketching wild constellations into the air with her fingertip and muttering to herself in some old-world dialect that hadn’t been spoken aloud in centuries.</p>

    <p>Shade watched for a while, unseen.</p>

    <p>Eventually, she stepped out of shadow and said, “You know those lines don’t connect.”</p>

    <p>Yethryn didn’t look down. “Neither does fate. But we follow it anyway.”</p>

    <p>It wasn’t exactly friendship. But from then on, Shade would return—always in silence, never by invitation.</p>

    <p>She didn’t care for the riddles. She barely tolerated the rambling theories about constellations made of dead languages and dream-geometry. But she paid attention. Because every now and then, Yethryn said something useful.</p>

    <p>Something dangerous.</p>
    <p>Something prophetic.</p>

    <p>One night, Shade arrived just as Yethryn was charting a new starpath, one lined in spirals that bent back on themselves like coiled serpents. “A skyquake,” she whispered, eyes glowing with starlit ink. “The heavens will blink, and something old will crawl through the crack.”</p>

    <p>Shade said nothing. But she returned the next week with coin, a question, and a sealed compass that wouldn’t stop humming.</p>

    <p>It became a pattern.</p>

    <p>Shade would come. Ask questions. Pay in coin, secrets, or favors. Yethryn would answer—sometimes directly, sometimes in verse. She once described a falling star as “a god’s lost tooth tumbling into memory.”</p>

    <p>It meant nothing to most. But to Shade, every cryptic mutter was a possible path to something rare. Something hidden. Something powerful.</p>

    <p>It was in one of those strange, sky-mapped ramblings that she first heard the name <strong>Captain Maxwell Bloodmoon</strong>.</p>

    <p>“A thief of tides,” Yethryn said, absently pointing to a constellation shaped like a blade wrapped in rope. “He sails the line between what is and what should’ve never been. The stars liked him, once.”</p>

    <p>Shade asked no further questions that night. But later, when she needed passage into the darker waters of the Empire, she knew exactly whose name to chase.</p>

    <p>She never thanked Yethryn for the information.</p>
    <p>Yethryn never asked her to.</p>

    <p>They weren’t friends. They didn’t pretend otherwise. But theirs was a quiet kind of alliance—one shadow, one starlight. Two women who saw the world tilted sideways and knew the sky never lied, even when it stopped making sense.</p>

    <p>And so Shade kept coming.</p>
    <p>And Yethryn kept watching the sky.</p>

    <p>And between them, maps were drawn in silence—<br>
    Not of roads or ruins,<br>
    but of futures still trying to be born.</p>

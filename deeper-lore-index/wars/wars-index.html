            <p>To gaze upon the Ember Desert today is to witness the remains of paradise undone. Once a realm of breathtaking beauty, where rivers shimmered like starlight beneath the canopy of the Verdant Expanse, it was a land untouched by war—until the world’s first true necrotic plague spread in silence. The War of the Dead was not declared with armies and banners, but with a whisper in the dark. The undead did not seek conquest—they sought unmaking. And they succeeded. By the time the final battle was waged in Zareth’Lai, the jungle had already begun to die. It was not a victory that saved the realm, but a sacrifice so immense it sundered nature itself. In the aftermath, the Ember Desert was born—a blasted wasteland of cracked stone, crystalline remnants, and silent winds that remember every scream.</p>

            <p>But peace would not return.</p>

            <p>Centuries later, the very magic used to destroy the undead gave rise to a new war—this time between those who feared the desert’s arcane mutations, and those who wished to master them. From the ashes rose the Crystal Forests, strange and beautiful structures pulsing with raw magic. To the Dwarves of the Ember Holds, they were a threat to all life. To the Crystal Magi, they were a gift from the past—a chance to evolve magic beyond its boundaries. And so began the Fractured Arcanum: a war of philosophy, invention, and desperation, where war-golems clashed against crystal-bound mages, and the laws of reality fractured beneath the Burning Spires. It ended in devastation once more, with both sides undone by the very forces they sought to control.</p>

            <p>Now, the Ember Desert remains quiet—but never healed. Its people are hardened, its land treacherous, and its past still whispering beneath the dunes. Some say no land has paid more dearly for its survival.</p>

            <p>And though creation brought wonder, it also left shadows in its wake. Not all things born from that first breath were meant to be understood. Somewhere, nestled deep within the folds of what came to be, something was hidden. A secret, still pulsing in the quiet places of the world.</p>

            <p>To look upon the Empire of Tides today—a union of traders, sailors, scholars, and explorers—is to see a rare harmony. But this peace is not natural. It is not old. It was not earned through vision or diplomacy. It was carved from wreckage, soaked in blood and saltwater, and bound together by a tidal wave that shattered everything.</p>

            <p>Long before the Empire existed, the seas were lawless. Oceanic Elves ruled the storms, Sea Dwarves held the trenches, and Corsair Kings preyed upon all who dared sail between. Each faction believed the tides were theirs by right—by birth, by invention, by fire. For decades, they warred across the open sea and beneath it, summoning krakens, building mechanical leviathans, binding drowned souls to cursed ships. Magic and metal tore through coral fleets and glass-armored subs alike. Trade became plunder. Diplomacy became sabotage. Every horizon held an enemy.</p>

            <p>And then the sea ended it.</p>

            <p>The Night of the Drowned Moon washed away the age of conquest. The wave came not from spell or siege, but from the deep—a force so massive, so ancient, it made kings into wreckage and armies into driftwood. No faction claimed victory. All crawled from the wreckage equal: broken, grieving, and afraid of what the ocean might do next.</p>

            <p>What rose from that silence was something no one had expected—a fragile alliance. The elves turned from rulers to guardians. The dwarves turned their forges to rebuilding. Even the Corsair Kings, the few who lived, abandoned piracy for profit. Thus began the Empire of Tides, a nation held not by love or lineage, but by the memory of what almost destroyed them all.</p>

            <p>Yet beneath the surface, nothing is ever still. The haunted wrecks remain. Ghost ships still drift where the trenches run deepest. And some say the wave that ended the war wasn’t punishment… but a warning.</p>

            <p>Once, these lands were one. Forest and mountain, ley line and storm—bound in balance. Elves and dwarves walked them as allies, shaped them with craft and magic alike. But harmony, no matter how golden, is always mortal. And when pride curdles into ambition, even the heavens may break.</p>

            <p>The first fracture came not from steel, but from spellcraft. The High Elves, unsatisfied with balance, sought dominion. Their magic reached for the sky itself, a spell meant to lift the land from the world below. But the ritual did not raise them to glory—it tore reality apart. The Sundering of the Heavens shattered the continent, ruptured the skies, and flooded the world with arcane chaos. From its wreckage rose the Celestial Highlands, floating shards bound by dwarven ingenuity, and the Ironwood, a scarred forest where broken alliances would one day heal. Magic was never the same again.</p>

            <p>But pride dies hard. Though humbled by failure, the High Elves did not abandon their thirst for power. In the new age, they traded open conquest for quiet chains. With silver tongues and enchanted contracts, they enslaved those left vulnerable in the post-Sundering world. Dwarves were forced into servitude. Iron Elves were divided, manipulated into compliance. The Ironwood, once shared in blood and trust, became a gilded cage.</p>

            <p>Until the chains broke</p>

            <p>Whispers turned to fire. Rebels rose from root and ruin, dwarves and elves bound not by race, but by memory and pain. The War of Chains swept through the Ironwood like a storm, toppling towers and unmaking tyrants. When it ended, no crown stood over the forest—only kin. The Ironwood Kin. Not a nation of conquest, but of brotherhood. Of resilience. Of stories carved in bark and stone, told in two voices, never again silenced.</p>

            <p>In the sky above, the Celestial Highlands remain distant and cold. The High Elves rule still—but their old rival now walks free. The world has never forgotten the wars born from these lands. The Sundering twisted the world. The Chains unbound it.</p>

            <p>But the scars still shine, in both wood and sky.</p>

            <p>The Twilight Isles were never meant to choose. They were born of balance, shaped by a sacred cycle that gave rise to both the Shadar-Kai and the Kalashtar—twilight and dawn, shadow and light, memory and dream. For eons, that cycle turned like a celestial tide, guiding the flow of magic, life, and rebirth.</p>

            <p>But some forces cannot abide balance. And some wars are not fought for land or power, but to unmake what is.</p>

            <p>The war that came to the Isles did not merely claim lives—it unspooled the weave of time itself. The Solar Theocracy of Auris sought to end the twilight, to burn it away in the name of a sun that would never set. In their zeal, they shattered the cycle. The Shadar-Kai, desperate to survive, cast the Wail of the Void—a spell of loss so profound it swallowed the dawn and silenced the sun.</p>

            <p>What followed was not victory, but stillness.</p>

            <p>Now the Isles linger in an unchanging dusk. The Kalashtar, once reborn with every rising light, have faded into myth. The Shadar-Kai walk through the half-light with hollow eyes, their magic potent but stagnant. The sun returns in other lands, but it is weaker, as if mourning what it cannot restore. The war is long over, yet the world still bears its shadow.</p>

            <p>The Twilight Isles are a place where time forgot how to move, where memory carries more weight than prophecy, and where silence speaks louder than the sun ever did. They are a monument to a cycle that died screaming.</p>

            <p>And no one knows if it will ever turn again.</p>
